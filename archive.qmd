- I'm definitely more of a cat person. And I'd say I'm a film fan. So I made [<i class="bi bi-film"></i> a Twitter account that posts clips of cats in movies, called FilmCats](https://twitter.com/filmcats). It's a manual process, but I wanted the clips all in one place, hence a feed devoted to films that have cats in them. Meow!
- Data is everywhere...even in candy. Made [<i class="bi bi-pie-chart"></i> a real-life pie chart and histogram out of M&Ms](https://twitter.com/zachbogart/status/1202779889184567298), grouped by color...I'm not OCD, you're OCD!
- Skittles do this neat color-bleed when they sit in water. Which means you can make [<i class="bi bi-droplet-half"></i> a pie chart from the Skittles candy color bleed](https://twitter.com/zachbogart/status/939647709253955584). And throw in a histogram for good measure.
