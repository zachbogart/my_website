    "text": "Try Out Koji  Exploration and Drafting Notes\nI‚Äôve been sketching out font ideas in the margins of college notebooks for years, so I thought it might be time to formalize one of them. The result is Koji, a typeface based off of a simple jig I would draw in my workbooks during class.\nThe main idea of Koji was to base all of the characters off of a simple template. But, as I began formally defining the font, it of course came down to some aesthetic choices. Creating this font was an incredible experience and I hope to improve it more and more, adding new characters to support more languages and tightening up each letter to improve usability."

    "text": "Why Koji?\nNaming a font is arguably as hard as creating one. I could say it was chosen because Koji fungal blooms are sort of round like this font. Or I could say it‚Äôs a principal ingredient in fermenting soy sauce, a condiment that is simple yet complex, just like this font. But the truth is far less poetic: it came from an online word finder. I wanted a name that used an uppercase ‚ÄúK‚Äù and a lowercase ‚Äúj‚Äù because those are two of my favorite letters in this typeface. So I searched for a word that fit the bill and came across ‚ÄúKoji‚Äù and it just grew on me. It‚Äôs easy to say, it has a cool but as you now know somewhat tacked-on backstory, and it looks good when written in the font, which is always a plus. Overall, a simple and catchy name for what I hope is your new favorite font."
