It has now undergone a renovation but it is still proving useful. Very cool to see!\n\n\n\nWhen will course notes follow the Wikipedia model?\nYihui Xie\n\nOver the summer, I worked with Joyce Robbins on an online resource for a course at Columbia University called ‚ÄúExploratory Data Analysis and Visualization‚Äù, or EDAV for short. The course covers how to visualize/work with data using R. We wanted to make a resource for students that had all the information about how to get started as well as examples to learn by doing.\nThe result is edav.info/, a resource combining examples, advice, and other things to help students start visualizing/working with R. There are several pages on the basics, pretty examples of different plot types, and helpful discussions on how to get the most out of the course and of R itself. Also, we ensured the resource was easy to modify so students could propose changes and help the quality continuously improve. As an added touch, we created a custom logo for the resource and custom icons for each chapter. We are very excited with the result and hope students enjoy exploring the resource and its examples.\nWe are excited to say that edav.info/ received an honorable mention prize in the 1st Bookdown Contest hosted by the package‚Äôs author, Yihui Xie, and RStudio. Feel free to checkout our submission for a more formal explanation of the resource."

We also admire that he listens to so many podcasts while lying down.\nFiveThirtyEight\n\nI was listening to an episode of What‚Äôs The Point?, a podcast about data from FiveThirtyEight, and getting excited. Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec were on the show talking about DearData, their yearlong exploration of data visualization through personal correspondence. For fifty-two weeks, the pair of data visualization experts sent postcards to each other, but these were not your average Hallmark cards. Every postcard was a hand-made figure concerning something they tracked in their lives for that week. Themes ranged from clocks to swearing to privacy and the resulting postcards embodied their personal style of telling stories with data. I loved listening to their project and was intrigued when the podcast ended with a challenge: try it for yourself, dear listener. The podcast asked its audience to have a go and make their own postcard with the theme of ‚Äòpodcasts‚Äô and send it in. I had been interested in data visualization for some time and here was a great excuse to play around with data and inject some creative flair. So I gave it a try.\nI decided to track WHEN and HOW I listened to podcasts. I recorded the time of day, my listening position (standing, sitting, etc.), and whether I used speakers or headphones. After a week, I had a collection of data points that described my week in podcasts. I made a simple grid and used a light table to fill in the correct cells. The result was an eye-catching postcard that has a lot of hidden data if you look closely.\nIt was a lot of fun tracking my behavior and making the postcard. I encourage you to check out DearData. Also, if you have the desire to track things but aren‚Äôt sure how to keep it organized, check out Feltron‚Äôs apps, Daytum and Reporter, which make it easy to record anything you want to track. Have fun!\n:star: FiveThirtyEight has posted the collection of postcards they received, totaling seventy-seven. I was excited to see my entry was among their five favorites. I encourage you to explore them all. It‚Äôs incredible to see what people can do with data when you let them loose.\n\nDataset & Findings\n\nOverview\n\n20 Podcasts\n15 Hours\nDate Range: March 14‚Äì20, 2016\n\n\n\nBreakdown\n\nMost Popular Position: Standing Up\nStanding Up: 43.96%\nSitting: 25.27%\nDriving: 16.48%\nLying Down: 14.29%\nMost Popular Delivery: Speakers\nSpeakers: 52.75%\nHeadphones: 47.25%"

    "text": "Try Out Koji  Exploration and Drafting Notes\nI‚Äôve been sketching out font ideas in the margins of college notebooks for years, so I thought it might be time to formalize one of them. The result is Koji, a typeface based off of a simple jig I would draw in my workbooks during class.\nThe main idea of Koji was to base all of the characters off of a simple template. But, as I began formally defining the font, it of course came down to some aesthetic choices. Creating this font was an incredible experience and I hope to improve it more and more, adding new characters to support more languages and tightening up each letter to improve usability."

    "text": "Why Koji?\nNaming a font is arguably as hard as creating one. I could say it was chosen because Koji fungal blooms are sort of round like this font. Or I could say it‚Äôs a principal ingredient in fermenting soy sauce, a condiment that is simple yet complex, just like this font. But the truth is far less poetic: it came from an online word finder. I wanted a name that used an uppercase ‚ÄúK‚Äù and a lowercase ‚Äúj‚Äù because those are two of my favorite letters in this typeface. So I searched for a word that fit the bill and came across ‚ÄúKoji‚Äù and it just grew on me. It‚Äôs easy to say, it has a cool but as you now know somewhat tacked-on backstory, and it looks good when written in the font, which is always a plus. Overall, a simple and catchy name for what I hope is your new favorite font."
