## Jump In!

*(give it a sec to load)*

Click a node to explore its nearest neighbors. Arrows point toward [increasing complexity](#how-to-understand-the-network). Happy building!

### Background

[Factorio](https://factorio.com/) is a [management game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_and_management_simulation) where you survive by building automated systems on an alien planet. The game is built on creating ever more complicated items from simpler building blocks. It can get [quite complicated](https://www.pcgamer.com/see-what-a-factorio-factory-looks-like-after-500-hours-of-work/), but the basic process involves making things that can accomplish tasks and chaining them together. There are a lot of things you can build, and this visualization will let you explore how the items relate to one another in terms of build requirements.

### How to understand the network

The network above shows all items in Factorio (almost; see [Method](#method)) and their build relationships. The item images are the nodes and the arrows are the edges. 

To illustrate how the arrows work, let's highlight the *Transport_belt* node:

![](factorio_transport_example.png){width=500px} 

**Arrows** point in the direction of **increasing complexity**. For example, an arrow between *Iron_gear_wheel* and *Transport_belt* means an *Iron_gear_wheel* can be used to make a *Transport_belt*: 

  - Relationship: An *Iron_gear_wheel* is a **building block** for a *Transport_belt*

Looking at all of the arrows that point **toward** a node shows what items are **required to build** that node:

  - Recipe: A *Transport_belt* uses an *Iron_plate* and an *Iron_gear_wheel* as building blocks

Looking at all of the arrows that point **away** from a node shows what items use that node as a **building block**:

  - Recipe: A *Transport_belt* is used in building an *Underground_belt*, a *Fast_transport_belt*, a *Logistic_science_pack*, a *Lab*, and a *Splitter*

### Interaction

The graph allows for easy navigation and manipulation of the network. Navigation buttons are available as well as Mouse and Keyboard interactions. **Pan** and **Zoom** to orient the graph. Nodes can be **clicked** to highlight nearest connections (direct neighbors, in and out degree) or use the **dropdown menu**. Nodes can also be **dragged** to expose hard-to-see connections.

### Method

Built using the [`visNetwork`](https://datastorm-open.github.io/visNetwork/) package. Images from [Factorio Wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com/) (grateful the wiki organization was so clean, but of course Factorio pros would keep it that way!) Items that only link to themselves—such as Raw_fish or Space_science_pack—were excluded. An arrow only describes a requirement, *not* a quantity; many relationships require multiple items to successfully build. Network contains `r dim(nodes)[1]` nodes and `r dim(edges)[1]` edges.
