I've been sketching out font ideas in the margins of college notebooks for years, so I thought it might be time to formalize one of them. The result is Koji, a typeface based off of a simple jig I would draw in my workbooks during class.

The main idea of Koji was to base all of the characters off of a simple template. But, as I began formally defining the font, it of course came down to some aesthetic choices. Creating this font was an incredible experience and I hope to improve it more and more, adding new characters to support more languages and tightening up each letter to improve usability.

## Included Unicode Blocks
- [Basic Latin (U+0020-U+007E)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Latin_(Unicode_block))
- [Latin-1 Supplement (U+00A0-U+00FF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement_(Unicode_block))

## Why Koji?

Naming a font is arguably as hard as creating one. I could say it was chosen because [Koji fungal blooms](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aspergillus_oryzae.jpg) are sort of round like this font. Or I could say it's a principal ingredient in fermenting [soy sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_sauce), a condiment that is simple yet complex, just like this font. But the truth is far less poetic: it came from an [online word finder](https://word.tips/). I wanted a name that used an uppercase "K" and a lowercase "j" because those are two of my favorite letters in this typeface. So I searched for a word that fit the bill and came across "Koji" and it just grew on me. It's easy to say, it has a cool but as you now know somewhat tacked-on backstory, and it looks good when written in the font, which is always a plus. Overall, a simple and catchy name for what I hope is your new favorite font. 

## Try it out!

Hope you enjoy the Koji typeface.
