Noun Project is a site that provides icons for everything. I have [a collection of my own icon designs on Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/zachbogart/uploads/) that you can choose from to spice up your own projects. I add new designs often, so check back to see what's available.

Checkout all of my icon designs over at [my Noun Project profile page](https://thenounproject.com/zachbogart/).

Noun Project supports creators when people download their icons. Whether you choose to buy one of my designs individually (fully customizable), sign up to [their NounPro subscription service](https://thenounproject.com/accounts/upgrade/) (full-access, in-app integration, and more), or just do a free basic download of my designs in black (with attribution), you directly support my work and allow me to continue creating great icons. I appreciate it immensely and hope you enjoy my designs.
