Hi there! My name is Zach and I am interested in the connections between science, design, and data. My educational background is in data science, neuroscience, and computer science. I enjoy making things and sharing knowledge.

If you enjoy your stay, consider supporting me in a [variety of different ways](/support/). Much appreciated. :orange_heart:

Hope you're having a great day on the internet. Thanks for stopping by!
