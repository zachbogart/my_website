Hi there! My name is Zach and I am interested in the connections between science, design, and data. My educational background is in [data science](http://datascience.columbia.edu/), [neuroscience](https://www.bu.edu/neuro/), and [computer science](https://www.bu.edu/cs/). I enjoy making things and sharing knowledge.

If you enjoy your stay, consider [throwing a digital coffee my way](https://ko-fi.com/zachbogart) :coffee:. Much appreciated. :orange_heart:

Hope you're having a great day on the internet. Thanks for stopping by!
