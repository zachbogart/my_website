<p>I’m not a master of Tableau, so I always am happy to find places where I can get a toehold on it and make it work for me. It is such a powerful tool, but it can be intimidating. Here are three quick things—one big, two small—that helped me out.</p>
<div id="color-by-multiple-dimensions" class="section level2">
<h2>Color by Multiple Dimensions</h2>
<p>This was said off-hand in a section of <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/tableau10-advanced/">a helpful Udemy course</a> I was working through and it became a go-to method for plotting things with many nested categories. Super useful to see how things break down visually.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simply command click to select two variables and drag them to the color box</strong></li>
<li>You can reorder the grouping of the variables by dragging one above the other in the shelf.</li>
<li>Definitely an example of a feature that is hard to find, but I end up using it all the time.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="command-click-to-drag-a-variable-copy" class="section level2">
<h2>Command Click to Drag a Variable Copy</h2>
<p>I would often have a setup of rows and columns, but want to filter out some part of one of the variables, or split into pages somehow. Dragging a new variable from the left may mean you have to alter the default aggregate function and that gets annoying (looking at averages, say, and you drag a new one, defaulting to sum). You can command-click-and-drag to solve this.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Command-click-and-drag your nice variable to preserve desired aggregations</strong></li>
<li>Simple but saves a lot of hassle and makes it more fluid</li>
</ul>
<div id="update-tableau-can-do-this" class="section level3">
<h3>2020-08-Update: Tableau Can Do This!</h3>
<p>You can select a given variable and change the default aggregation to something other than <code>SUM</code>! Will try to take advantage, although I will probably only change it after dragging a new variable over with the wrong aggregation several times over!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="click-and-hold-to-pan-maps" class="section level2">
<h2>Click and Hold to Pan Maps</h2>
<p>I found maps annoying to navigate, till I learned you can do it all from the mouse. I would go back and forth clicking tools to get the placement right, usually between pan and zoom. Instead of toggling, you can click-and-hold and it will allow you to pan around, and zoom with scrolling.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Click-hold-and-drag to pan without switching tools</strong></li>
<li>More fluid interaction</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="power-tools-are-powerful-if-they-start-to-fade-away" class="section level2">
<h2>Power Tools are Powerful If They Start To Fade Away</h2>
<p>If a tool is a pain to work with, it gets in the way of why you are using it in the first place. You want to get something done, to do something creative.</p>
<p>I’m still amassing these kinds of tricks for all sorts of data-related tools. That way, after some familiarity with a workflow and being comfortable with different tools, they can step aside and work for you rather than against you.</p>
