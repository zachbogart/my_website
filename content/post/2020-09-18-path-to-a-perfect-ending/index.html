<p>There is so much choice for watching TV, people sometimes ask if a show is “worth watching”. Well, let’s take a look at some of the shows that have garnered a lot of praise, and see how they wrap up.</p>
<p>No spoilers ahead. Just ratings.</p>

<p>First, we gotta grab a bunch of shows. I went off <a href="https://stacker.com/stories/980/100-best-tv-shows-all-time">a list I found</a>, picked ones that were no longer airing, cherry picking a little from that group. Below, we have a dataframe of different shows, their IMDb codes, and their season spans (ignored a few seasons so things don’t break).</p>

<p>Here we make a function that unpacks the dataframe made above and sends the info over to a script I made to get IMDb data. I have <a href="/post/rvest-wizardry/">used</a> <a href="/post/cartoonies/">it</a> <a href="/post/treehouse-of-horror/">a</a> <a href="/post/family-guy/">bunch</a>, here modded it slightly to printout some status updates.</p>

<p>We see some familiar series finales, like Breaking Bad and Six Feet Under, as well as some other shows that had perfect episodes during their run, but ended with a lower-rated finale.</p>
<p>Some interesting things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game of Thrones had several perfect episodes, but the progression of the final season led to a poor finish.</li>
<li>Game of Thrones has four perfectly-rated episodes in the collection, with Breaking Bad also scoring high with three.</li>
<li>Breaking Bad is the only show with an episode rated a perfect ten (data collected cuts off at tenth decimal). Interestingly, it is the antepenultimate episode, two from the last (and yeah, this post might be one big excuse to use that word in context).</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go watch some TV (strictly research, you understand).</p>
<p>Till next time!</p>

<!--Section on Learning (general notes that came up)-->
</div>
<div id="learning" class="section level2">
<h2>Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most of the head-banging involved getting R to pass the vectors for seasons into the looping function. I needed to use double brackets to pass the value I wanted along.</li>
<li><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html">Tribbles</a> are loverly. They made it easy to write out a dataframe from scratch. Also, apparently they’re <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribble">a Star Trek thing</a> as well.</li>
<li>The <code>geom_text()</code> labels turned out just okay. Found it a little challenging to place as well as plot the desired value. Played around with average across final episodes, but didn’t like the result.</li>
<li>Creating a list to then filter on with <code>%in%</code> was a useful trick. A little wrangling required to get it down just to a vector.</li>
<li>Started <code>dplyr</code> work to get the final episodes with some grouping and other stuff. But <code>top_n</code> came in to save the day, fit the bill perfectly.</li>
<li>The scraper I made “breaks” when a show has an episode with no ratings, which happens for a variety of reasons (pilot, duplication, etc.). Would be nice to somehow ignore these entries, since right now the best I can do is ignore the offending season entirely.</li>
</ul>
