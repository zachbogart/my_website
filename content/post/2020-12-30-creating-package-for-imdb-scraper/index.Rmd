## TL;DR

I made [an R package called imdbScraper](https://github.com/zachbogart/imdbScraper) to go get IMDb data on your favorite TV shows. Go give it a try!

## Some Context

I have done some posts in the past using [a web scraper I made with rvest](https://zachbogart.com/post/rvest-wizardry/). It allowed me to get ratings and other info about episodes for different TV shows. The trouble was it was an R script that I had to reference every time or copy to different places. 

Recently, I have been working to better understand abstracting out code so that it can be reused. This is an effort to try to abstract out the IMDb Scraper work I have done as an R package. This way, if I (or other people) ever need to use it, it's just another package to include.

## The imdbScrpaer Package

The imdbScraper package has a [repo on Github](https://github.com/zachbogart/imdbScraper). Feel free to try it out!

Basically all this work amounts to is taking the function I made previously and putting it in an R package. Now, this is all that needs to be done:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("zachbogart/imdbScraper")
```

Then we can go get data from your favorite show:

```{r}
library(imdbScraper)

the_simpsons = imdbScraper::grab_imdb_ratings("tt0096697", c(1:7))

head(the_simpsons)
```

The `imdb_code` (like "tt0096697") can be found in the IMDb url for the desired show.

## Result

I was finding myself moving files around I already made or redoing old work. This should make it much easier for future me (or other people) to use this function for new projects. Give it a try!

Till next time!

<!--Section on Learning (general notes that came up)-->
## Learning

- There are distinctions when using other packages for your own functions in your own packages. Packages shouldn't `library()` a package, but include imports in the DESCRIPTION file. Ran into some roadblocks when pipes weren't working in my function call, but I had to *depend* the `magrittr` package in the DESCRIPTION file rather than include it as an *import*. This [post on connecting to other packages](https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/depends.html) helped out.
- There are a lot of fields to fill in for a package and I'm sure mine are not all filled in properly. However, telling RStudio you want to make a package is very helpful in setting up the template and the necessary materials.
