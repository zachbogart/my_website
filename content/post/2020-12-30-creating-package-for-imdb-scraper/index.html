<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/zachbogart/imdbScraper">an R package called imdbScraper</a> to go get IMDb data on your favorite TV shows. Go give it a try!</p>
</div>
<div id="some-context" class="section level2">
<h2>Some Context</h2>
<p>I have done some posts in the past using <a href="https://zachbogart.com/post/rvest-wizardry/">a web scraper I made with rvest</a>. It allowed me to get ratings and other info about episodes for different TV shows. The trouble was it was an R script that I had to reference every time or copy to different places.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been working to better understand abstracting out code so that it can be reused. This is an effort to try to abstract out the IMDb Scraper work I have done as an R package. This way, if I (or other people) ever need to use it, it’s just another package to include.</p>

<h2>The imdbScrpaer Package</h2>
<p>The imdbScraper package has a <a href="https://github.com/zachbogart/imdbScraper">repo on Github</a>. Feel free to try it out!</p>
<p>Basically all this work amounts to is taking the function I made previously and putting it in an R package. Now, this is all that needs to be done:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;zachbogart/imdbScraper&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then we can go get data from your favorite show:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(imdbScraper)

the_simpsons = imdbScraper::grab_imdb_ratings(&quot;tt0096697&quot;, c(1:7))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;tt0096697&quot;
## [1] 1
## [1] 2
## [1] 3
## [1] 4
## [1] 5
## [1] 6
## [1] 7</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>head(the_simpsons)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 7
##   show        season episode air_date   title                       rating votes
##   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;   &lt;int&gt; &lt;date&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;

## 2 The Simpso…      1       2 1990-01-14 Bart the Genius                7.7  3814

<p>The <code>imdb_code</code> (like “tt0096697”) can be found in the IMDb url for the desired show.</p>

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>I was finding myself moving files around I already made or redoing old work. This should make it much easier for future me (or other people) to use this function for new projects. Give it a try!</p>
<p>Till next time!</p>

<div id="learning" class="section level2">
<h2>Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are distinctions when using other packages for your own functions in your own packages. Packages shouldn’t <code>library()</code> a package, but include imports in the DESCRIPTION file. Ran into some roadblocks when pipes weren’t working in my function call, but I had to <em>depend</em> the <code>magrittr</code> package in the DESCRIPTION file rather than include it as an <em>import</em>. This <a href="https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/depends.html">post on connecting to other packages</a> helped out.</li>
<li>There are a lot of fields to fill in for a package and I’m sure mine are not all filled in properly. However, telling RStudio you want to make a package is very helpful in setting up the template and the necessary materials.</li>
