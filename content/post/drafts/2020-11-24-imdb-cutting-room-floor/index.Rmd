<!--Starting Blurb-->
Here are some rough drafts on the cutting room floor from exploring IMDb data with the [rvest scraper](https://zachbogart.com/post/rvest-wizardry/).

<!--Put actual work here-->
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      cache.lazy = FALSE,
                      fig.width = 8,
                      fig.height = 5,
                      message = FALSE)
```

```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
source("../2020-08-28-simpsons/rvest_scraper.R")
theme_set(theme_light())
```

## House M.D.

```{r}
house <- grab_imdb_ratings("tt0412142", c(1:8))
```

Show data by season.
```{r}
# Facet by season
house %>% 
  ggplot(aes(air_date, rating)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point(aes(size = votes), alpha = 0.5) +
    facet_wrap(~ season, scales = "free_x") +
    labs(title = "House M.D. by Season",
         x = "Air Date",
         y = "Rating")
```

## Game of Thrones

```{r}
got <- grab_imdb_ratings("tt0944947", c(1:8))
```

Trying to show multiple seasons in one chart. Using "Day of the Year" to plot on a common axis.
```{r}
# Color by season
got %>% 
  mutate(day_of_year = as.integer(format(air_date, "%j"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(day_of_year, rating, color = factor(season))) +
    geom_line(aes(group = season)) +
    geom_point(aes(size = votes), alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(title = "Game of Thrones",
         x = "Day of the Year",
         y = "Rating",
         size = "# Votes",
         color = "Season")
```

## Both GOT and House

Group scatter for multiple shows.
```{r}
# Two show scatter
bind_rows(house, got) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(episode, rating, color=show)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "Two Show Scatterplot")
```

## House As One Line

Plotting a show as a single line.
```{r}
house %>% 
  mutate(id = seq.int(nrow(house))) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(id, rating)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point(aes(size = votes)) +
    ylim(5, 10) +
    labs(title = "House M.D.")
```

## Show Combos

```{r}
simpsons <- grab_imdb_ratings("tt0096697", c(1:31))
regular_show <- grab_imdb_ratings("tt1710308", c(1:8))
```

Looking at the end of two shows, split by small multiples.
```{r}
bind_rows(got, regular_show) %>% 
  filter(season >= 7) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(episode, rating)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = interaction(show, season), color = factor(season), linetype = show)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = factor(season))) +
    facet_wrap(~ show)
    
```

Big scatterplot of multiple shows by episode count.
```{r}
bind_rows(house, got, simpsons) %>% 
  group_by(show) %>% 
  mutate(ep_id = row_number()) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(ep_id, rating, color = show, alpha = 0.4)) +
    # geom_line() +
    geom_point(aes(size = votes)) +
    ylim(5, 10) +
    labs(title = "Three Shows of Very Different Length")
```

## Breaking Bad

Showing season progression in a flipped way. Every line is a season.
```{r}
bb <- grab_imdb_ratings("tt0903747", c(1:5))

bb %>% 
  mutate(show_count = seq.int(nrow(.))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(rating, show_count, color = show)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = season)) +
    geom_point(aes(size = votes), alpha = 0.8) +
    # geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  
    labs(title = "Breaking Bad") 
```

## BB and the Wire

Combining multiple shows with smoothing.
```{r}
# with the wire
wire <- grab_imdb_ratings("tt0306414", c(1:5))

bind_rows(wire, bb) %>% 
  group_by(show) %>% 
  mutate(show_count = row_number()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(episode, rating, color = show)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = interaction(show, season))) +
    geom_point(aes(size = votes), alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  
    labs(title = "Breaking Bad & The Wire") +
  
    facet_wrap(~ season)
```


## Simpsons, One Line

Showing one show as a rough and smooth form.
```{r}
simpsons %>% 
  mutate(show_count = seq.int(nrow(.))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(show_count, rating)) +
    geom_line(aes(group = season)) +
    geom_point(aes(size = votes), alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  
    labs(title = "The Simpsons") +
  
    ylim(0, 10)
```
