<!--Starting Blurb-->
Not revolutionary or original, but personally educational. Getting everything from a single `.js` file into Observable required rethinking things a bit in my head.

Embedding a notebook: So. Darn. Satisfying. 

Thanks [Amelia](https://wattenberger.com/). Thanks [Observable](https://observablehq.com/@zachbogart/fullstack-d3-scatterplot). :heart:

<!--Put actual work here-->
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      cache.lazy = FALSE,
                      fig.width = 8,
                      fig.height = 5,
                      message = FALSE)
```

## what this is

Taking code exercise from "Fullstack D3" and putting it into an Observable notebook. I find it challenging to actually publish work with D3 since it requires you to setup a place to put it. Observable makes it easy to do that.
