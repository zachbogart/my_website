## Happy holidays!
Here's [what I ended up finishing](https://zachbogart.github.io/advent_of_code/2021/) for [this year's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

Hope you enjoy, learn something, or whatever. And hope you're having a good holiday. Or if you're reading this some other time, just "day", I guess.

Till next time!
