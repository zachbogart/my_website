<!--Starting Blurb-->
<p>Let’s look at the “Road To” episodes of Family guy, where Brian and Stewie go on adventures together. How do they compare to the rest of the episodes aired?</p>
<!--Put actual work here-->
<p>Using the <a href="/post/cartoonies/">scraper I made</a>, we can get the episode ratings for Family Guy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>fg &lt;- grab_imdb_ratings(&quot;tt0182576&quot;, c(1:18))</code></pre>
<div id="they-make-quite-a-pair" class="section level2">
<h2>They Make Quite a Pair</h2>
<p>Below we plot the ratings, this time highlighting the “Road to” episodes.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># just the &quot;road to&quot; episodes
roads &lt;- fg %&gt;% 
  filter(str_detect(title, &quot;Road&quot;))

# all other episodes
rest &lt;- fg %&gt;% 
  filter(!str_detect(title, &quot;Road&quot;))

y_text = 6.8
point_color = &quot;#999999&quot;
road_color = &quot;#008080&quot;
  
ggplot(data = roads, aes(air_date, rating)) +
  # other episodes
  geom_point(data = rest, aes(air_date, rating, size = votes), 
             color = point_color, alpha = 0.2, stroke = 0) +
  # line for highlighted episodes
  geom_line(color = road_color) +
  # &quot;road to&quot; episodes
  geom_point(aes(size=votes), color = road_color) +
  # labels
  geom_text(aes(y = y_text, 
                label = title,
                hjust = &quot;left&quot;), angle = -45, color = road_color) +
  # label lines
  geom_segment(aes(x = air_date, y = rating, 
                   xend = air_date, yend = y_text),
               linetype = &quot;longdash&quot;, color = road_color) +
  labs(title = &quot;We&#39;re Off on the Road to High Ratings&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;&#39;Road to&#39; Family Guy episodes over time&quot;,
       x = &quot;&quot;, 
       y = &quot;IMDb Rating&quot;,
       size = &quot;# Votes&quot;, 
       caption = plot_caption)</code></pre>

<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “Road To” episodes are usually highly rated in relation to episodes aired during a similar time</li>
<li>The ratings for the “Road To” episodes are based on more votes than other episodes (more users gave their opinion for these specific episodes).</li>
<li>Highest-rated episode for all seasons of Family Guy is “Road to the Multiverse”. I explored the best and worst further in <a href="/post/cartoonies/">this post</a>, which includes other shows as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Till next time!</p>
