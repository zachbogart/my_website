<!--Starting Blurb-->
Let's look at the "Road To" episodes of Family guy, where Brian and Stewie go on adventures together. How do they compare to the rest of the episodes aired?

<!--Put actual work here-->

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      cache.lazy = FALSE,
                      fig.width = 8,
                      fig.height = 5,
                      message = FALSE)
```


```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
source("../2020-08-28-simpsons/rvest_scraper.R")

theme_set(theme_light())

plot_caption <- "zachbogart.com\nSource: IMDb"
```

Using the [scraper I made](/post/cartoonies/), we can get the episode ratings for Family Guy.
```{r cache=TRUE}
fg <- grab_imdb_ratings("tt0182576", c(1:18))
```

## They Make Quite a Pair

Below we plot the ratings, this time highlighting the "Road to" episodes. 
```{r}
# just the "road to" episodes
roads <- fg %>% 
  filter(str_detect(title, "Road"))

# all other episodes
rest <- fg %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(title, "Road"))

y_text = 6.8
point_color = "#999999"
road_color = "#008080"
  
ggplot(data = roads, aes(air_date, rating)) +
  # other episodes
  geom_point(data = rest, aes(air_date, rating, size = votes), 
             color = point_color, alpha = 0.2, stroke = 0) +
  # line for highlighted episodes
  geom_line(color = road_color) +
  # "road to" episodes
  geom_point(aes(size=votes), color = road_color) +
  # labels
  geom_text(aes(y = y_text, 
                label = title,
                hjust = "left"), angle = -45, color = road_color) +
  # label lines
  geom_segment(aes(x = air_date, y = rating, 
                   xend = air_date, yend = y_text),
               linetype = "longdash", color = road_color) +
  labs(title = "We're Off on the Road to High Ratings",
       subtitle = "'Road to' Family Guy episodes over time",
       x = "", 
       y = "IMDb Rating",
       size = "# Votes", 
       caption = plot_caption)
```

Results:

- The "Road To" episodes are usually highly rated in relation to episodes aired during a similar time
- The ratings for the "Road To" episodes are based on more votes than other episodes (more users gave their opinion for these specific episodes).
- Highest-rated episode for all seasons of Family Guy is "Road to the Multiverse". I explored the best and worst further in [this post](/post/cartoonies/), which includes other shows as well.

Till next time!

<!--Section on Learning (general notes that came up)-->
## Learning

- `geom_segment()` was helpful to get the dotted lines for the labels

## Some Links

- [Using `hjust` to align text](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26684023/how-to-left-align-text-in-annotate-from-ggplot2): was helpful to get at altering position of text.
