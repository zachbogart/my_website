I find I have to do a lot of grouping in pandas and I reach for this blog post by Shane Lynn all the  time to get it done. I've found grouping things in pandas difficult sometimes, usually when  I want to create a column in the original dataframe by grouping stuff. This technique solves that and I'm super grateful to it.
