Probably not the best way to create embeddable code, but it puts something to the screen. :)

<!--Starting Blurb-->
Going off of the [D3 Livestream with Ian and Anjana](https://youtu.be/cNSM8pfEA3g). Very lovely walkthrough for making a scatterplot using D3 in Observable. Followed along and got a nice result. Also a good chance to try to embed a code cell from an Observable Notebook into a webpage. I've done some D3 stuff in the past, but am still learning to cook. Up to basic knife skills... 

<!--Put actual work here-->
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      cache.lazy = FALSE,
                      fig.width = 8,
                      fig.height = 5,
                      message = FALSE)
```

## Penguin Scatterplot

<!-- D3 Example -->
<div id="observablehq-002efeaa"></div>
<script type="module">
import {Runtime, Inspector} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@observablehq/runtime@4/dist/runtime.js";
import define from "https://api.observablehq.com/@zachbogart/mirror-neuron-1-lunch-in-the-d3-kitchen.js?v=3";
const inspect = Inspector.into("#observablehq-002efeaa");
(new Runtime).module(define, name => name === "chart" ? inspect() : undefined);
</script>

- Embedding `chart` cell

<!--Section on Learning (general notes that came up)-->
## Learning

- I had to reconfigure the SVG creation to get the embedded code to display something (otherwise it just was showing what was hardcoded, like the one seagreen circle).
- I'm not sure how to get the color legend to work in this situation
- Observable is fantastic for power users, but can be slightly intimidating, or at least require a change of perspective. Reordering cells is fantastic, but can be difficult to parse how something was done after the fact. After some practice, should be more intuitive (wore a path to follow).
