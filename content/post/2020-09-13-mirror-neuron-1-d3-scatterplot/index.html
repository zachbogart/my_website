<!-- 
Probably not the best way to create embeddable code, but it puts something to the screen. :)

<!--Starting Blurb-->
<p>Going off of the <a href="https://youtu.be/cNSM8pfEA3g">D3 Livestream with Ian and Anjana</a>. Very lovely walkthrough for making a scatterplot using D3 in Observable. Followed along and got a nice result. Also a good chance to try to embed a code cell from an Observable Notebook into a webpage. I’ve done some D3 stuff in the past, but am still learning to cook. Up to basic knife skills…</p>

<h2>Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>I had to reconfigure the SVG creation to get the embedded code to display something (otherwise it just was showing what was hardcoded, like the one seagreen circle).</li>
<li>I’m not sure how to get the color legend to work in this situation</li>
<li>Observable is fantastic for power users, but can be slightly intimidating, or at least require a change of perspective. Reordering cells is fantastic, but can be difficult to parse how something was done after the fact. After some practice, should be more intuitive (wore a path to follow).</li>
