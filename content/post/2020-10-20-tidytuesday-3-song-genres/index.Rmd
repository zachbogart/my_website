<!--Starting Blurb-->
Working with TidyTuesday data, this time some Spotify info. Always was interested in seeing the introduction of lowercase in song titles, so this accomplished that.

<!--Put actual work here-->
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      cache.lazy = FALSE,
                      fig.width = 8,
                      fig.height = 5,
                      message = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)

theme_set(theme_light())

plot_caption = "zachbogart.com\nSource: Spotify"
```


```{r}
# reading in data
df <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-21/spotify_songs.csv')
```

## What are the Playlist Genres Present?

```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(playlist_genre, fill=playlist_genre)) +
    geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) +
    
    labs(x = "Genre",
         y = "# Songs",
         title = "Pretty Even Split Between Genres",
         subtitle = "Spotify Playlist Genres by count",
         caption = plot_caption)
```

## What is the distribution of tempos for each genre?

```{r}
avg_tempos = df %>% 
  group_by(playlist_genre) %>% 
  summarise(avg_tempo = mean(tempo)) %>% 
  mutate(row = as.numeric(row.names(.))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_tempo))
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(tempo)) +
    geom_freqpoly(aes(color = playlist_genre)) +
    geom_text(data = avg_tempos, aes(y = 2500 - (row * 100), 
                                     label = round(avg_tempo),
                                     color = playlist_genre), x = 245) +
    facet_grid(playlist_genre~.) +
    
    labs(title = "EDM Has a Preference",
         subtitle = "Tempos (bpm) for different music genres",
         x = "Tempo (bpm)",
         y = "# Songs",
         color = "Genre",
         caption = plot_caption)
```

## when did song titles start being in lowercase?

```{r}
spotify = df %>% 
  mutate(track_album_release_date = as.Date(track_album_release_date))

spotify = spotify %>% 
  select(-starts_with("play")) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  filter(
      (!is.na(track_name)) &
      (!is.na(track_album_release_date))
    ) %>%
  mutate(lowercase =  str_detect(track_name, '^[a-z]'))
```

```{r}
upper = spotify %>% 
  filter(lowercase == FALSE)

lower = spotify %>% 
  filter(lowercase)
```

Can see that some artists put out several tracks (albums for some) using lowercase track names.

```{r}
lower %>% 
  group_by(track_artist) %>% 
  summarise(lowercase_songs = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lowercase_songs))
```

```{r}

ggplot(data = upper, aes(track_album_release_date, duration_ms, color = lowercase)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_point(data = lower, alpha = 0.8) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#191414", "#1DB954")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale = 1/1000)) +
  
  labs(title = "Lowercase Track Titles is a New Thing",
       subtitle = "Song Length, by whether track starts with a lowercase letter",
       color = "Lowercase?",
       x = "Release Date",
       y = "Song Length (seconds)",
       caption = plot_caption)
  
```

- It's a relatively new phenomenon to use lowercase in a track title. It is a good way to stand out from the crowd.
