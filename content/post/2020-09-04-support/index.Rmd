No pressure, though. 😊

## You're Just Feeling Generous

- ☕ **<a href="https://ko-fi.com/zachbogart" target="_blank">Give a Coffee</a>**: The classic way to donate to a nerd on the internet. Head to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/zachbogart" target="_blank">Kofi</a> and order me a digital coffee (I'll probably opt for a hot chocolate, myself). Thanks!

<script>
  kofiWidgetOverlay.draw('zachbogart', {
    'type': 'floating-chat',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.text': '',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.background-color': '#ffffff',
    'floating-chat.donateButton.text-color': '#fc6c5f'
  });

## You'd Like Something in Return

- 📈 **<a href="https://join.robinhood.com/zachb524" target="_blank">Get Free Stock</a>**: If you've always wanted to start investing, but aren't sure how, here's an easy way to do so. <a href="https://join.robinhood.com/zachb524" target="_blank">Sign up for Robinhood</a> and you'll get a free stock (could be $100+), while also throwing one my way.
- 🐙 **<a href="https://thenounproject.com/zachbogart/" target="_blank">Download Some Nouns</a>**: I make little icons and post them to <a href="https://thenounproject.com/zachbogart/" target="_blank">Noun Project</a>. If you like that sort of thing, paying for one directly supports me. And you get a nice little icon out of the deal ([project page](https://zachbogart.com/project/nouns/)).
- 👕 **<a href="https://mztees.cool/" target="_blank">Wear a T-shirt</a>**: If you look great in t-shirts, I got you covered. I have a collection of nerdy designs over at <a href="https://mztees.cool/" target="_blank">mztees.cool</a>. A portion of every sale directly supports me. There are also some mugs and such if that's more your jam ([project page](https://zachbogart.com/project/mztees/)).

Thanks a bunch! 🧡
