I'm digging Quarto. It was pretty easy to make this into a website, plus it makes adding in plots really seamless.

## Challenges

Pretty painlessly, was able to revamp my website using Quarto. Some challenges encountered:

-   The navbars and sidebars are independent. I'm not using them to their full potential at the moment.
-   I can't seem to get the blog title banner to show up on smaller screens. Even had some troubles seeing it when forking the quarto-web repo and looking at their blog. Will have to look into this.

Overall, looking forward to using Quarto more often.

Always learning,

Zach

2022-04-24: I ended up getting the title and subtitle to appear in blog posts on smaller screens by copying the [quarto-web repo](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web) more closely. It still feels finicky, though, like it could break if the text banner color is altered. Ongoing and will have to keep in mind when fiddling with things.
