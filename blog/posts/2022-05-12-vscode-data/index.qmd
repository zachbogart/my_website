## Rainbow CSV

"Looking" at data can take many forms, but opening a CSV in Excel feels a little like poor form. I found [Rainbow CSV for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) helpful for seeing the columns in a CSV. Totally an example of seeing this in the wild and going "I want that."

## Format Document

Working with a lot of JSON, there are a lot of cases where the data is not pretty, instead wrapped onto one line. [Format document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#_formatting) is quite useful and I wish there was an analog in RStudio.
