Here are some things that I got up to this month.

## Writing Ramblings 
- Couldn't get the TED intro sound out of my head, so did some [aural tasting notes](/blog/posts/2023-08-09-tedsound/). Tennis in an echo-ey room.
- Made a ["low powered" sign](/blog/posts/2023-08-10-lowPowerMode/) to help avoid a dumb addiction.
- Reviewed [frozen mini candy bars](/blog/posts/2023-08-20-frozenCandy/). Twix won.
- Wrangled a [fridge magnet set](/blog/posts/2023-08-29-againstBeautiful/).

## Observable
- Up to 56 [YouTube vids that make me smile](https://observablehq.com/d/1908139ee245dd0b)
- Counting [how often Lofi Girl does things](https://observablehq.com/d/7d58603e12f49d8f)

## If you missed it
- [Fancy Wordle](https://observablehq.com/@huh/fancy-wordle) can respark your NYT puzzle play. Has been fun to share with others, hint at solution, or play around.
- Made a [calendar](https://zachbogart.com/projects/llm-calendar) out of LLM responses. A weird little blurb to start each day.
