"Looking" at data can take many forms, but opening a CSV in Excel feels a little like poor form. I found [Rainbow CSV for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv) helpful for seeing the columns in a CSV. Totally an example of seeing this in the wild and going "I want that."
