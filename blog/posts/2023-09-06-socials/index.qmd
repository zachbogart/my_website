Here is my current approach toward different social platforms, ordered by the ones that I'm most excited by first.

## Instagram
**Eyeball Benders** *[Instagram â†—](https://www.instagram.com/zbnerd/)*

- If you ever got a Games Magazine in the mail, you may remember a section they had called Eyeball Benders, a visual puzzle where you try to identify the images of zoomed-in objects. I really enjoy that style and have been liking it as a way to communicate visual things that have happened to me recently.
- Expect images of recent activity, usually food, with spare descriptions. Reminders of what I got up to.
- In general, my approach is if you pulled up an image, and you asked me about it, I would be able to tell you a little story about that situation (what was going on if you zoomed out).

## Threads
**Random Blurbs** *[Threads â†—](https://www.threads.net/@zbnerd)*

- This goes for Instagram too, but I like Threads as a feed for random thoughts and musings. My guess is that this will not be used much, but we will see.

## ~~Twitter~~ X
**Statuses** *[~~Twitter~~ X â†—](https://twitter.com/zachbogart)*

- I have never been a devoted user to social media, but I have found ~~Twitter~~ X useful in that you can get the status on what people are working on. Posts here will likely be about work and such.
