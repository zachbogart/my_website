## Your Own Shortcut

Here is a helpful tool that a large language model was able to guide me towards: **making custom keyboard shortcuts with AppleScript and Automator**.

I use Chrome and wanted to have a way to get a new window from anywhere on my computer, in any application. While I could use Alfred to search the web, it will open a tab in a current window, often sending me to a different Desktop. Boo...

Instead, I can use Automator to make a script that is run when a keyboard shortcut is executed. For example, this is one I made to make a new Chrome window:

```
on run {input, parameters}
	tell application "Google Chrome"
		make new window
		activate
	end tell
end run
```

I can then make this into a Quick Action in Automator called `New Chrome Window`:

Then, in `System Preferences > Keyboard`, I can make an app shortcut that runs the Quick Action. Make sure that the shortcut name matches the name of the Automator Quick Action:

With this, I can run âŒƒâŒ¥â‡§âŒ˜C (which is easy to do with [my keyboard](https://observablehq.com/@zachbogart/i-dont-know-how-to-type?collection=@zachbogart/blog)) and I will get a new window to work with.

Hope this helps you with your own workflows. What little mods have you come up with?

Till next time!

*Note: applications will ask you for permission to exeucte the AppleScript; this is a one-time occurance for each application.*
