I end up making the same searches over and over. I always feel like I’m looking up the same things. So when I think of it, I’m going to try to make a blog post of it, even if it is a super minor detail. That way I can make my own little textbook of helpful tips/tricks that only gets better. 

These posts are little notes to myself in the future with things I do a lot in different programs.
