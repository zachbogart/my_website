These are some notes I found in a notebook from a several months ago, when I wanted to go through the [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) documentation. Since then, they have updated heavily, with a more standalone documentation site. thought I'd share these as some notes showing me getting my head around a new charting library.

- Covering concepts like marks and transforms
- Tried a pass-through to color things in
