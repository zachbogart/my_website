This is a draft blog post. Here are some directions to help out:

1. **Copy over**: copy/rename the folder
2. **Work on post**: you can render on save to see while running. You can use the `Render` button to start it up (Settings gear has options for where to display rendering).
3. **Setup YAML**: Add in title, date, tags, etc. You can look at what other tags have been used, or feel free to make your own. *Note: You must set `draft` to `false` for the post to be visible.* For example, this template is set as a draft, so doesn't get rendered.
