When you give a fridge magnet set to a data person, some wrangling may occur.

This is a little magnet set I got, sorted by starting letter. Every letter is sorted by the word length then alphabetized.

There were too many words to lay it out horizontally. Here it is turned around, with a few annotations:

Some quick reactions:

- You don't get any J's, X's, or Z's
- Most magnets start with A, S, or T

[Future explorations](https://github.com/zachbogart/huh-data/issues/34) abound.

### Notes
- Started by left-aligning all vertical rows, but got skewed
- Since all magnets have the same height, could do easy comparison across letters
