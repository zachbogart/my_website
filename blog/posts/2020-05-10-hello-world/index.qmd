I'm digging Quarto. It was pretty easy to make this into a website, plus it makes adding in plots really seamless.

## Challenges

Pretty painlessly, was able to revamp my website using Quarto. Some challenges encountered:

- The navbars and sidebars are independent. I'm not using them to their full potential at the moment.
- I can't seem to get the blog title banner to show up on smaller screens. Even had some troubles seeing it when forking the quarto-web repo and looking at their blog. Will have to look into this. 

Overall, looking forward to using Quarto more often.

Always learning, 

Zach
