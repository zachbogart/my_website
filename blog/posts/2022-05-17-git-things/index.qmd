## Sourcetree

There was some complex git stuff that I had to do at work and [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) helped show what was going on. It's one of those intimidating apps that does it all, but it is hepful for seeing what is happening and I like the [staging options](https://confluence.atlassian.com/sourcetreekb/viewing-file-status-of-a-repository-785616002.html) that include nesting, which I find more intuitive than RStudio's output.

### Amend Previous Commit in Sourcetree

I use this often in RStudio, but was not sure where it lived in Sourcetree. It's essentially the "no wait, but also" button, adding in a little more to the recent commit. In RStudio, it is a prominent checkbox, but in Sourcetree, **it is under "Commit Options..." in the commit dialogue**.
