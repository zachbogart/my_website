It is such a powerful tool, but it can be intimidating. Here are three quick things—one big, two small—that helped me out.\nColor by Multiple Dimensions This was said off-hand in a section of a helpful Udemy course I was working through and it became a go-to method for plotting things with many nested categories. Super useful to see how things break down visually.\n Simply command click to select two variables and drag them to the color box You can reorder the grouping of the variables by dragging one above the other in the shelf. Definitely an example of a feature that is hard to find, but I end up using it all the time.   Command Click to Drag a Variable Copy I would often have a setup of rows and columns, but want to filter out some part of one of the variables, or split into pages somehow. Dragging a new variable from the left may mean you have to alter the default aggregate function and that gets annoying (looking at averages, say, and you drag a new one, defaulting to sum). You can command-click-and-drag to solve this.\n Command-click-and-drag your nice variable to preserve desired aggregations Simple but saves a lot of hassle and makes it more fluid   Click and Hold to Pan Maps I found maps annoying to navigate, till I learned you can do it all from the mouse. I would go back and forth clicking tools to get the placement right, usually between pan and zoom. Instead of toggling, you can click-and-hold and it will allow you to pan around, and zoom with scrolling.\n Click-hold-and-drag to pan without switching tools More fluid interaction   Power Tools are Powerful If They Start To Fade Away If a tool is a pain to work with, it gets in the way of why you are using it in the first place. You want to get something done, to do something creative.\nI’m still amassing these kinds of tricks for all sorts of data-related tools. That way, after some familiarity with a workflow and being comfortable with different tools, they can step aside and work for you rather than against you.\nImage Credit 3D Cubes by Zach Bogart from the Noun Project\n  ","date":1595030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595030400,"objectID":"a8dd6fc7b016088c659c4c78ab6f87fe","permalink":"/post/two-tableau-tricks/","publishdate":"2020-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/two-tableau-tricks/","section":"post","summary":"I’m not a master of Tableau, so I always am happy to find places where I can get a toehold on it and make it work for me.

Whenever I see a digital clock, I do a little math in my head. I try to take the numbers and, using only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, get them to come out to twelve. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d try to get an exhaustive list of times that this trick applies to. Let\u0026rsquo;s figure it out!\nimport re import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  Get with the times First we need to get a list of the times. I\u0026rsquo;m going to work with strings. Let\u0026rsquo;s go through some numbers and rule out invalid ones by places.\nvalid = [] for x in range(100, 1260): num = '' num += str(x) if len(num) == 3: if int(num[0]) \u0026lt;= 9 and int(num[1]) \u0026lt;= 5: valid.append(num) if len(num) == 4: if int(num[0]) \u0026lt;= 1 and int(num[1]) \u0026lt;= 2 and int(num[2]) \u0026lt;= 5: valid.append(num)  Cool. We can check that we have 720, which is half of all times since they all repeat once. Now we can go about making possible math expressions.\nlen(valid)  720  valid[:4]  ['100', '101', '102', '103']  Prep the times To do this, I\u0026rsquo;m going to put together strings of math expressions for all permutations of the numbers, then evaluate them and see which ones work. Certainly brute force, but it\u0026rsquo;ll work. First, I make a dictionary of all permutations of the numbers for each time.\n# moded from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-permutation-given-string-using-inbuilt-function/ from itertools import permutations def allPermutations(str): perm_array = [] # Get all permutations of string 'ABC' permList = permutations(str) # print all permutations for perm in list(permList): result = ''.join(perm) perm_array.append(result) return list(set(perm_array))  time_dict = {} for time in valid: time_dict[time] = allPermutations(time)  time_dict['957']  ['795', '957', '579', '597', '759', '975']  Now, I go and add in all possible combinations of operators (+, -, *, /) in between the numbers. I also add in parens since eval follows PEMDAS and we want to avoid that in many cases.\nequations = {} for time, perms in time_dict.items(): eq = '' ops = '+-*/' if len(time) == 3: equations[time] = [] for perm in perms: for a in ops: for b in ops: eq = f\u0026quot;{perm[0]}{a}{perm[1]}{b}{perm[2]}\u0026quot; eq = re.sub(r'([0-9])', r'\\1)', eq) eq = '(((' + eq equations[time].append(eq) if len(time) == 4: equations[time] = [] for perm in perms: for a in ops: for b in ops: for c in ops: eq = f\u0026quot;{perm[0]}{a}{perm[1]}{b}{perm[2]}{c}{perm[3]}\u0026quot; eq = re.sub(r'([0-9])', r'\\1)', eq) eq = '((((' + eq equations[time].append(eq)  equations['100'][:10]  ['(((0)+0)+1)', '(((0)+0)-1)', '(((0)+0)*1)', '(((0)+0)/1)', '(((0)-0)+1)', '(((0)-0)-1)', '(((0)-0)*1)', '(((0)-0)/1)', '(((0)*0)+1)', '(((0)*0)-1)']  Look at the time Cool. Now that we have a bunch of expressions, let\u0026rsquo;s evaluate them and see what we get.\nthey_work = {} for time, eq_list in equations.items(): for eq in eq_list: try: result = eval(eq) except ZeroDivisionError: continue if result == 12 and time not in they_work.keys(): they_work[time] = eq  they_work  {'116': '(((1)+1)*6)', '124': '(((2)+1)*4)', '125': '(((5)+1)*2)', '126': '(((6)*1)*2)',

automated systems on an alien planet. The game is built on creating ever more complicated items from simpler building blocks. It can get quite complicated, but the basic process involves making things that can accomplish tasks and chaining them together. There are a lot of things you can build, and this visualization will let you explore how the items relate to one another in terms of build requirements.\n How to understand the network The network above shows all items in Factorio (almost; see Method) and their build relationships. The item images are the nodes and the arrows are the edges.\nTo illustrate how the arrows work, let’s highlight the Transport_belt node:\n Arrows point in the direction of increasing complexity. For example, an arrow between Iron_gear_wheel and Transport_belt means an Iron_gear_wheel can be used to make a Transport_belt:\n Relationship: An Iron_gear_wheel is a building block for a Transport_belt  Looking at all of the arrows that point toward a node shows what items are required to build that node:\n Recipe: A Transport_belt uses an Iron_plate and an Iron_gear_wheel as building blocks  Looking at all of the arrows that point away from a node shows what items use that node as a building block:\n Recipe: A Transport_belt is used in building an Underground_belt, a Fast_transport_belt, a Logistic_science_pack, a Lab, and a Splitter   Interaction The graph allows for easy navigation and manipulation of the network. Navigation buttons are available as well as Mouse and Keyboard interactions. Pan and Zoom to orient the graph. Nodes can be clicked to highlight nearest connections (direct neighbors, in and out degree) or use the dropdown menu. Nodes can also be dragged to expose hard-to-see connections.\n Method Built using the visNetwork package. Images from Factorio Wiki (grateful the wiki organization was so clean, but of course Factorio pros would keep it that way!) Items that only link to themselves—such as Raw_fish or Space_science_pack—were excluded. An arrow only describes a requirement, not a quantity; many relationships require multiple items to successfully build. Network contains 198 nodes and 481 edges.\n  ","date":1567641600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"64f3ac12c766f6184a9025ae6260a7fd","permalink":"/project/factorio/","publishdate":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/factorio/","section":"project","summary":"Visualization of the crazy connections of a complicated video game","tags":["data"],"title":"Factorio Recipe Network","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is a visualization of one of Ninja\u0026lsquo;s Fortnite runs. I plotted his eliminations with a game map overlay and connected them with smooth curves, creating an approximate movement path you can follow from start to finish. Accented with audio blurb annotations, you can get a good sense of his progression through the run.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to do something with Fortnite for a while now, so this serves as a toe in the water. This was a manual creation, but it has got me thinking how it would be lovely to auto-generate these kinds of plots for streamers in the future. Someday.\n  Progression of one of Ninja\u0026rsquo;s Fornite runs   Visualization Notes The yellow dots represent the approximate locations of the eliminated players. The locations were found by watching Ninja\u0026rsquo;s YouTube video, \u0026ldquo; Ninja Destroys The Entire Lobby!! 24 Elim Solo\u0026quot;, and taking screenshots when eliminations were made. The mini map in each screenshot was then used to place a point on the visualization.\nThe light blue path is created by drawing a line between the twenty-four yellow elimination points and applying smooth curves. Because of this, the light blue path is only an approximation of Ninja\u0026rsquo;s movements and is taking liberties at certain spots, particularly with sniper eliminations. For example, the top-most yellow dot in the visualization is far from the preceding elims, implying Ninja walked over to that player to get the elimination. In actuality, Ninj a sniped that player from far away rather than going up a large mountain to attack at close range. It would be interesting in the future to try a more accurate recreation of player movement, but I think this approximation tells a compelling story.\nThe dotted-line portion of the path approximates the initial descent from the bus. The video does not include the bus\u0026rsquo;s transit path, so it is omitted (it would have made things a little crowded, anyway).\nThe blue dots signify when Ninja started using a mech and when he transitioned into a new mech (where \u0026ldquo;mech\u0026rdquo; is the B.R.U.T.E. vehicle). Not all eliminations after those points were made in mechs. For example, up at Salty Springs, he exits the mech to acquire four eliminations before reentering to cover more ground. In general, it would be interesting to further explore how the type of elimination could be better displayed without overloading the viewer (color by weapon used, use of vehicle, etc.).\nThe annotations were taken from Ninja\u0026rsquo;s stream audio after the elimination occurred. They are lightly edited.\nThe dark blue squiggly line defines the border of the southwest corner of the game map. Initially I was going to include the entire outline of the map, but it served no purpose. The location names are placed where they appear on the game map. This causes some overlap of paths, points, and text (particularly at Salty Springs and Fatal Fields), but the intention was to go for accuracy with regards to the game map placement.\nThe text was typeset in Arial; apologies, type-lovers.\nThe color palette was chosen to compliment Ninja\u0026rsquo;s logo identity as of September 2019.\nFortnite Context This run\u0026rsquo;s landing site was Pandora, a crossover event with Borderlands (termed \u0026ldquo;Mayhem\u0026rdquo; in-game). This limited-time rift zone gave players regenerative shields.\nThis run was recorded shortly after changes were made to the turbo build feature, which were later reverted. More info on changes to the game can be found in the Fortnite patch notes.\n","date":1567641600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"c2ac5eea5f43b4d7febdd2bc8a7e168d","permalink":"/project/ninja/","publishdate":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ninja/","section":"project","summary":"Visualization of one of Ninja's Fortnite runs","tags":["data"],"title":"Ninja, 24 Elim Solo","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I love stand-up comedy and have watched many specials over the years. I thought a collection of comedy specials would be an interesting dataset to explore, which led me to create this project showing selected stand-up specials plotted in terms of their ribaldry, or use of swearing. When looking into analyzing comedy specials, I found practically every comedian used some collection of swear words in their act. The interesting finding was how varied its use was across different comedians and even across different specials from the same comedian. Some comedians rely heavily on them, while others rarely use them at all. Some used them often in their earlier specials, but less so in their later ones. It is interesting to see how a specific comedian uses these words to their advantage as well as when they choose to use specific types of words. By plotting the use of swearing across a comedy special, you can get a sense of a comedian’s style of comedy, how it has changed over the years, and how it differs from other comedians’ styles.\nFor data collection, I created a CSV that contained every timestamp and type of swear word used across several comedy stand-up specials. This CSV was fed through a Processing script that plotted the individual words for each special. The result is a graphic that succinctly orders and displays the relative ribaldry of selected stand-up specials. I am particularly proud of the amount of information that is contained in each plot, including the titles, the release dates, the set lengths (both numerically and visually), the individual word counts, the total word count, the relative severity of words, and the timestamps themselves.\nThis project involved watching a bunch of comedy specials, which was a lot of fun. I enjoyed collecting the data and hope that this project’s collection of stand-up specials will continue to grow. I encourage you to explore the current visualization and check back here periodically for new updates to the dataset.\nAn interactive version of the dataset is now available on my Tableau Public profile.\nThis version includes a word cluster map, plots of swearing timestamps, a heat table, and a plot based on gender. In addition, every page has filters allowing for custom views of the dataset. Enjoy.\nNote: The Tableau version currently has data up to, and including, the specials added on January 18, 2017.\nDataset   123 Specials\n  63 Comedians\n  7,830 Minutes\n  All Words: 13,002 Times\n  F-Word Only: 5,981 Times\n  Source: netflix.com, louisck.net, spotify.com\nA Note on Ordering and Word Choice In this visualization, I define \u0026ldquo;relative ribaldry\u0026rdquo; to be the severity of selected curse words in a comedy special, meaning the curse words classified as more severe are placed higher up the axis. Derivatives of the displayed words are not differentiated between (For example, “D*MMIT is counted as “D*MN” \u0026amp; “BULLSH*T” is counted as “SH*T”). The y-axis shows the different kinds of curse words used in the special and is identical across all comedy specials. However, the collection of words displayed on the y-axis does not necessarily represent every recorded type of curse word for a given special. In addition, other suggestive themes may be present in individual specials that these graphics cannot accurately differentiate between. The collection of words on the y-axis was selected based on use across all specials as well as a desire to include a variety of words that varied in levels of severity. The collection may change over time due to new comedy specials being added. In addition, the ordering of the words based on severity is not intended to be an absolute ranking. Your personal preferences may rank the collection differently, but the current order hopefully provides a relative placing of the words that gives a sense of differences between comedy specials in terms of swearing.\n","date":1567641600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"1ee7875012541e65f2cad69c6c13d80b","permalink":"/project/comedy/","publishdate":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/comedy/","section":"project","summary":"Exploration of Stand-Up Comedy Specials Ordered by Relative Ribaldry","tags":["data"],"title":"Ribaldry in Stand-Up","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557619200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557619200,"objectID":"978d4d43a41f44ad930f652db1db3e9a","permalink":"/project/filmcats/","publishdate":"2019-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/filmcats/","section":"project","summary":"Twitter account of film clips that have cats in them.","tags":["other"],"title":"FilmCats","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been sketching out font ideas in the margins of college notebooks for years, so I thought it might be time to formalize one of them. The result is Koji, a typeface based off of a simple jig I would draw in my workbooks during class.\n       The main idea of Koji was to base all of the characters off of a simple template. But, as I began formally defining the font, it of course came down to some aesthetic choices. Creating this font was an incredible experience and I hope to improve it more and more, adding new characters to support more languages and tightening up each letter to improve usability.\nIncluded Unicode Blocks   Basic Latin (U+0020-U+007E)  Latin-1 Supplement (U+00A0-U+00FF)  Why Koji? Naming a font is arguably as hard as creating one. I could say it was chosen because Koji fungal blooms are sort of round like this font. Or I could say it\u0026rsquo;s a principal ingredient in fermenting soy sauce, a condiment that is simple yet complex, just like this font. But the truth is far less poetic: it came from an online word finder. I wanted a name that used an uppercase \u0026ldquo;K\u0026rdquo; and a lowercase \u0026ldquo;j\u0026rdquo; because those are two of my favorite letters in this typeface. So I searched for a word that fit the bill and came across \u0026ldquo;Koji\u0026rdquo; and it just grew on me. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to say, it has a cool but as you now know somewhat tacked-on backstory, and it looks good when written in the font, which is always a plus. Overall, a simple and catchy name for what I hope is your new favorite font.\nTry it out! If you try out the Koji typeface, consider throwing a digital coffee my way ☕. Much appreciated. ❤️\nHope you enjoy the Koji typeface.\nVersion Log Jan 2019\n Initial release (1.000) Basic Latin (U+0020-U+007E) Latin-1 Supplement (U+00A0-U+00FF)  ","date":1546387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546387200,"objectID":"6bd42c11720d8f9a4a72725e357b5b5a","permalink":"/project/koji/","publishdate":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/koji/","section":"project","summary":"Hand-Made Typeface","tags":["featured","design"],"title":"Koji Typeface","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Over the summer, I worked with Joyce Robbins on an online resource for a course at Columbia University called \u0026ldquo;Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization\u0026rdquo;, or EDAV for short.

I will try to discover what the dataset can tell us, create some sketches, present them, and discuss the results. I will also try to discuss any shortcomings of the results as well as considerations made when making the sketches. This project will evolve over time as I continue to explore the dataset.\nNYC Borough Populations To begin, I thought I would get a sense of the context of the dataset. Before looking at the crime rates themselves, I’d like to better understand the population distribution of the region. So, I made a sketch showing the average populations of the five boroughs: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, and Queens.\n  Average Populations of the Five Boroughs   I started with the interest in seeing the region itself. I live near New York City, but I didn’t know which borough was which, so I wanted to get a sense of each one in relation to its neighbors. I found a simple map of the five boroughs and used that as the base. Then I averaged the population data I had for each borough and overlaid that on the map as a circle.\n  Adding in circles   At this point it showed the populations but the scales were ambiguous: it wasn’t clear how large the regions were, which borough was which, or what amounts the circles actually represented. After adding some labels \u0026amp; scales and tweaking the colors \u0026amp; sizes, I had a nice sketch of the region of interest.\nI think this sketch is an important starting point to the dataset because it helps to put the observer in the mindset of the data that will be presented. From the sketch, we can see that New York City is a very dense region with islands only a few square miles accommodating millions of people. We also notice the separation and population difference between Staten Island and the other four boroughs. From here, we are in a good space to look at the crime rates of the five boroughs.\nHowever, this sketch is not without its faults. I am reducing entire regions to a single number, which can hide nuances underneath the surface. For example, each borough is shown to have a fixed population when, in fact, the data shows every borough’s population has steadily increased from 2010 to 2014. The circles also seem to suggest that the populations are evenly distributed throughout each region, which is clearly false. A simple example is Manhattan, which has a big hole in the middle of it called Central Park. It also can be difficult to discern the divisions between the boroughs. The narrow strip of land below Brooklyn actually belongs to Queens, and because it’s not under a circle, it seems like it has no population.\nThe problems with this sketch stem from the fact that very little data is behind the result. It is only based on five values, which quickly leads to observers reading more into the sketch than it can provide. So while it is a good indicator of the region’s population in an abstract sense, it is dangerous to infer too much from this result.\nSome important notes:\n Representing numbers as area must be done carefully. Displaying a value as an area on a map involves a dimensional change, which must be taken into account. One cannot simply use the values as radii; this will cause the circles to represent the population squared, which leads to massive distortions in the data. Take your time and check your math!    Circles shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be mapped linearly   Building a visualization can blind you from the user’s needs. I was pretty happy with the unlabeled sketch early on, but showing it to someone quickly set me straight. It made sense to me since I had a background in the boroughs and their populations, but it was completely ambiguous to an incoming user. It was not clear which borough was which or what the scale was for the populations. So, make sure you always have the user in mind. They will often not have the background that you have with the data, but if you design it carefully, they won’t need to. The visualization will give them the background they need.  From here, we will look at the crime rates provided in the dataset.\nNYC Crime Rate Trends Looking at the crime rate data for each borough, I wanted to see how the values changed over time and whether certain crime types were trending up or down. To do this, I plotted the crime rates for the four recorded crime types across all five boroughs. The result was a table of plots showing the trends in crime rates between 2010 and 2014.\nThis graphic began as an interest in plotting trends that show how a value changes over time. So, my first thought went to the stock market. I pulled up the stocks app on my phone and checked the S\u0026amp;P 500.\n  This became my jumping-off-point for how I wanted to present the data. I wanted to accentuate how the annual crime rate values changed over time and present it like a stock plot, showing the trend and the “opening and closing values” for each time period.\nTo get a quick sense of how the data would look over time, I tried plugging the data I had into RAW. It quickly became apparent that the difference in scales was going to be a problem.\n  drastically different values   A quick test of the murder rates for each borough showed me that plotting all five boroughs on the same graph was going to bias the larger values in the bigger boroughs and make Staten Island’s crime rates look practically constant. Because of this, I decided to separate the types and boroughs into distinct plots, creating a table of twenty cells showing every trend individually. This choice allowed the data to have some breathing room and made it easy to focus on specific trends while also allowing for comparisons between trends.\nBefore I coded up the plot, I sketched out the plan using a whiteboard (whiteboards are cool). I liked the look, but I was debating what I should use to represent the value itself. I initially liked a horizontal line but that implied that the crime rate was constant for some time, which would be assuming more than the dataset could provide. So, I settled on a simple point and filled in the sketch accordingly. After doing this, I found that I would need to give ample room for the 2010 and 2014 value labels. With the general outline in mind, I wrote a Processing script to plot the table.\n   Try it with lines     Points are better   The resulting table of scatterplots gives a good sense of how the data changes over the five-year period and how different crimes and boroughs show different trends. This type of graph could be useful in identifying types of crimes that are on the rise and allocating resources in targeted areas to combat them. It also shows how different regions have different criminal environments, suggesting that blanket responses to crime may have negative effects on specific regions. Understanding these differences between regions is the first step to creating an effective response that will do the most good.\nPitfalls and Stylistic Choices The biggest problem with this graph is the same problem that plagued the population plot: lack of data. This dataset is very small, which means the “trends” displayed are only based on 5 points each. The graphs are a poor description of crime rate trends in the same way that a stock market graph of a single day is a poor description of financial trends. There is insufficient information to draw any sweeping conclusions about what type of crime is rising or falling. A more comprehensive dataset would be needed to back up the trends seen here. Being able to see fluctuations in crime rates at a granular level is a useful tool, but we need more data to work with from the beginning.\nAnother problem with this graphic is the linear mapping of each trend. Since I chose to split the trends into twenty separate plots rather than overlaying them all on a common graph, the axes could be tailored for each plot. This has its benefits, allowing for smaller numbers not to be pushed to the extremes by the more common ranges of the dataset. However, it also implies relationships that don’t hold up to scrutiny. The linear mapping is based on the ranges of the points involved, meaning a downward trend will look similar regardless of its scale. A trend with a downward tendency on the order of thousands could look identical to a downward trend on the order of dozens. This implies that these trends are identical when they clearly are different beasts. It also means small ranges will have much more volatile trends than larger ranges, evident in the blue plots of Staten Island. So, the compromise is to isolate each plot individually and zoom in on each one to see them fluctuate relative to each other. The tradeoff is the difference in axes is obscured and implies that trends are similar when they are actually separated by orders of magnitude. This ultimately blurs the understanding of what is represented by the y-axis.\nOne solution to explore in the future is connecting crime rates to populations. In the two graphics created so far, the connections between population and crime rates have been severed, causing problems like boroughs with drastic population differences showing similar crime trends. Factoring in this information will give a more nuanced sense of how different regions have different crime rates and how they change due to population, crime type, and time. Another solution is exploring how all the data could be overlaid on one graph with a logarithmic scale. That said, let’s work with what we have and discuss the choices made creating this graphic.\nSince the goal of describing a trend is so open-ended, a lot of stylistic choices need to be made to contain the data and guide the eye. The first consideration was how much data to display. The dataset itself almost serves as a table showing the trends, but it is too much information to view at once. At the opposite end, a table simply saying that the trend was downward or upward would describe the dataset, but it would hide too much. The compromise here was to show the trend as a graph but hide some of the values to highlight the shape of the trend rather than the individual values. Of course, the tradeoff was a lot of the data becomes hidden, meaning it is more difficult to see how drastic the changes between years are. In this instance, I wanted to see the progression of the data in the abstract, so obscuring some of the values from the user allowed me to center the focus and reduce clutter. The addition of the “opening and closing values” for 2010 and 2014 brought back some of the granular information of the dataset and provided specific context to those interested in exploring a specific trend.\nAdditional stylistic choices served to accentuate the trends and guide focus. The x-axis is only provided in the first plot because its information did not need to be repeated twenty times over. Providing it on only one plot with low contrast allows it to be ignored easily, but it’s presence helps to clarify any lingering confusions the user may have about the graphic’s structure. The use of boxes around the cells helps to contain each plot and differentiate between trends. When the boxes are omitted, the data seems to drift around and conflict with other trends. Using a low contrast box around each trend extends the tabular structure of the borough columns and crime type rows, making it easier to understand. Finally, the use of color serves as a way to highlight the trends and group them by boroughs. Since the rest of the graphic is in gray scale, the colors catch the eye and draw you immediately into the data. In addition, using color to group by borough made it easy to see the differences between regions. A simple example with the color removed shows that the lack of color requires the user to keep glancing at the row and column headings to understand what they are viewing. The addition of color allows for unconscious associations between borough and pigment, which means it is easier for the user to understand what each trend corresponds to. By combining boroughs and colors, the user makes an implicit color legend when they view the graphic, making additional clarifications with explicit color legends superfluous.\nFuture work could help to reduce stylistic problems and obstruction of data by making the graphic interactive. For example, hovering over one of the cells could bring up more detailed information about the values, summary statistics, and whether the trend is linear, exponential, logarithmic, etc. It also could allow broader tailoring of parameters like choosing to view only the Aggravated Assault plots or combining the data with the population plot to get a sense of place. Opening up the data and allowing more abilities to interact with it will lead to a better understanding of what the data can tell you and how it can shape future decision-making and policy changes.\nConcluding Note Tradeoffs are inherent when you present data. Taking data and presenting it always leads to some part of the dataset becoming hidden, bent, warped, exaggerated, reduced, or corrupted. It is important to understand that every time data is presented, there are compromises that must be made, which take you further and further from the dataset itself. The resulting tradeoffs can make a graphic easier to understand, hide a crucial fact, or even corrupt an entire body of work. So, being aware of tradeoffs is crucial to understanding what a graphic can tell you about a dataset and how it might be biasing or stretching the facts.\nDataset Stats  Date Range: 2010–2014 Average Population Total: 8,330,731  Source: www.nyc.gov via ColumbiaX edX Course\n","date":1481068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1481068800,"objectID":"531ef94594d3a0204040863a2460bf3c","permalink":"/project/nyc-crime/","publishdate":"2016-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/nyc-crime/","section":"project","summary":"Discussion of NYC Crime Dataset","tags":["data"],"title":"NYC Crime","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Olympic Games are always awash in data visualizations. This summer in Rio, The New York Times put out dozens of graphics showing athletes split across time and the Rio website kept people up to date on medal counts, athletes, and every possible subdivision of the data they could display.\nOver the sixteen days, watching the athletes bring home gold and glory, I wondered how much money each athlete gets for winning their event. How much is a gold medal worth and does it vary? Although the Olympic Committee does not give out prize money, many nations give athletes bonuses that vary drastically in amount and depend on the type of medal they bring home.\nTo portray this drastic difference, I plotted the relative amounts each nation paid to their gold medal athletes in the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics. Each bar is one nation, labeled with its ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code, with its height showing how much the nation spent on prize money for all its gold medalists. The area of each bar is split into vertical strips showing how much money each athlete received. Since the prize money is shown on a linear scale, comparisons can be made easily between different countries. For example, the United States (USA) and Russia (RUS) have nearly identical totals, but individual Russian athletes were given more than double the prize money compared to American athletes. Another striking result was when nations who earned one gold medal spent more than nations who had several gold medalists. The single gold medalist in Singapore (SGP) received more prize money than all ten of the French (FRA) gold medalists combined, and the single gold medalist in Azerbaijan (AZE) earned a little under the prize money given to all Australian (AUS), South African (ZAF), and Canadian (CAN) gold medalists combined.\nIt was interesting to see this side of the Olympics, a side rarely discussed during or even after the event.

I had been reading The New Yorker for a few years and loved seeing the variety of art that graced the cover each week. I wanted to see how The New Yorker covers had changed over time. To do this, I collected every cover of The New Yorker from 1925 to 2015, found the average color values, and presented them as one image.\nThe images were collected using a PhantomJS script that took a little snapshot of each cover. These snapshots were then sent to Martin Krzywinski’s Image Color Summarizer, which calculated the top ten average color values within the image. Because of the high clustering and precision, each image took about a minute to analyze. To automate the process, I used a Raspberry Pi to run a Python script that collected the average color values and percentages. Even with this setup, the dataset took over 80 hours to complete.\nOnce the data was collected, I used Processing to feed in the dataset as a CSV, produce color percentage bars for every cover, and save the result as a PDF. From there I used InDesign and Photoshop to create a layout for the visualization that provided some context as well as a style that was reminiscent of the covers themselves.\nThe finished product shows 4,620 covers of The New Yorker on a macroscopic scale, spanning nine decades.

Themes ranged from clocks to swearing to privacy and the resulting postcards embodied their personal style of telling stories with data. I loved listening to their project and was intrigued when the podcast ended with a challenge: try it for yourself, dear listener.

In the environment it begins its life in, the fetus breathes liquid rather than air in the form of amniotic fluid. During labor, the lungs expel the fluid by some remarkable mechanisms. Studies suggest that the hormone epinephrine mediates the absorption of the liquid in the lungs, allowing for the lungs to transition to inhaling and exhaling air. It is truly an amazing transformation. A miracle of childbirth.\nAnd this miraculous transition is happening all the time. On the global scale, the birthrate is about 4.3 births every second.

When a human comes into the world, it lets everyone know it’s here.\nBut what about blogs? What does a blog do when it comes into the world?\nWhen a blog comes into the world, it doesn’t make a sound. It\u0026rsquo;s like a modern twist on the old philosophical thought experiment about the tree falling in the forest.\nA blog’s birth is silent.\nIt also seems far less miraculous. In terms of work, with sites like Wordpress, anyone can have a simple blog in minutes. Minutes! Even starting from scratch, this site only took a day or two to make. There is much less effort involved, but there are still a lot of them. There are about 172,800 blogs created every day. That\u0026rsquo;s 120 blogs per minute (BPM is such a flexible acronym). The blog birthrate is more akin to the baseline rhythm of Ke$ha’s We R Who We R:\nBOOM, CHUCK, BOOM, CHUCK, BIRTH, CHECK, BOOM, CHUCK\u0026hellip;\nHittin’ on dudes…hard.\nAnd finally, people don’t notice new blogs. Yes, there are a bunch made every day, but very few will gain a sizable audience. It takes a lot of work to generate content that people will want to read and share with others. And this blog is no exception. But the amazing thing is, to modify one of my favorite movie quotes:\n\u0026ldquo;Not everyone can become a great blogger, but a great blogger can come from anywhere.\u0026rdquo; - Anton Ego (reviewing a french rat’s blog)\nI hope you enjoyed the first in what I hope to be many posts. I hope you thought it was interesting or entertaining or engaging or maybe even all of the above. Most importantly, I hope you found it bloggable.\nThanks for being a part of this blog’s audience, and I hope you come back again soon\u0026hellip;\n…hungry for more.\n002 Photo Famine Facebook is big. The site has about 1.44 billion monthly active users. Before we go any further, let’s get some sense of scale. Oftentimes I will gloss over numbers like these without fully comprehending the sheer hugeness of their size. So I will repeat to emphasize: 1.44 billion users. With a B.\nAs a comparison, there are currently about 7.3 billion humans in the world. So, the active monthly user population of Facebook is equivalent to about a fifth of the global population.\nTo put it another way, if you treat the total surface area of the Earth as the global population, the Facebook population would cover a region the size of the following countries combined:\n Russia Canada China United States Brazil Australia India Argentina Kazakhstan Algeria Democratic Republic of the Congo Greenland (Denmark) Saudi Arabia Mexico Indonesia Sudan Libya Iran Mongolia Peru Chad Niger Angola Mali South Africa Colombia Ethiopia  So that is a sizable group.\nAnd above all else, this group is doing one thing: posting photos. Over a quarter of a trillion photos (with a T now) are on Facebook with an additional 350 million being added every day. At these kinds of rates, an interesting question arises:\nCan Facebook run out of possible photos to post?\nWhat do I mean by this? Well, photos are split into small partitions call pixels. Given an image size and format, there is a limited amount of real estate and color options for those pixels, making the number of possible images finite. Granted there are a lot options to choose from. But with so many photos being posted, will we exhaust the options anytime soon?\nWe need to consider the formats of the images being posted. There are all sorts of image file formats, but let’s simplify things and see if we can look at how many images are possible for a single image file format and constant image dimensions.\nLet’s take a look at the PNG file format and the dimensions of a user’s cover photo.\nLet’s assume that every cover photo being posted has the same dimensions that perfectly fit the size allowed for cover photos. The cover photo dimensions for the desktop are 851 x 315 pixels. So, each cover photo contains 268,065 pixels that can each be a different color.\n The PNG file format supports several color palettes, but we will consider 24-bit. This means that the color values for each pixel are represented by a 24-bit number, allowing for 16,777,216 different color values per pixel. Multiplying through gives us:\n16,777,216 color values per pixel ^ 268,065 pixels\n≅ 10^(1,936,694) possible PNG cover photos\nThat is huge.\nAnd it would be a curious collection of images. It would have every imaginable image that could fit within its boundaries. The Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa with red hair. Screenshots of every corner of the globe. Pictures of every human living and dead. Pictures of you doing everything you have done in your entire life. Every word printed in every font and in every color and in every orientation. It would be all-inclusive. It would be like the visual version of pi. A Google Street view for the entire history of recorded and to-be-recorded time. It would be spectacular. The amazing thing is although they are huge, the possibilities are not endless. There is a boundary.\nWe better get posting.\n003: The Portable Encyclopedia  Wikipedia is amazing. There are many reasons why (and I hope to cover more reasons in the future), but here we will consider only one. And it is a big one delivered in a small package.\nPortability.\nUnlike older encyclopedias, Wikipedia was created in the era of computers, which brought in a revolutionary change to print as we know it. For the end user, the content you were reading no longer had to dictate the size of the medium you read it from. This was not always the case. Physical books (remember those?) do not have this ability. They are restricted by the medium they are printed on and have limited space per page on which to display content. That is why books are thick: they are stacking pages of content on top of each other and the user can flip through each one to view the content. That is also what makes them heavy. With modern technology, this problem disappears.\nNow, an entire book can be contained within a device thinner than the book itself. Instead of interacting with stacked sheets of paper, you interact with a single screen that displays the content you want to view. You interact with one page, but that one page can display all of the content you would ever dream of looking at. And the weight now depends on the device, not the content:\n  iPhone 6 Plus weight: 6.07 oz iPhone 6 Plus weight (with Wikipedia): 6.07 oz  So with this revolutionary change, how portable is Wikipedia? Let’s look at the alternative.\nWikipedia is a collection of articles that could be printed, like any other content, as a book. This has been done in some capacity, but as XKCD pointed out there would be some problems. But who cares! Hooray for Hypothetical Land!\nWhat would it look like? It would be quite big. There is, of course, a Wikipedia article on the subject but the weight is currently missing, which is a crucial question when it comes to portability. So what would it weigh?\nThis is where we go beyond what physical books can do. Wikipedia is expanding all of the time. This question about the weight of Wikipedia was answered by Vsauce back in March of 2013.\nAbout 7000 pounds.\nBut since then, Wikipedia has not been sitting still. As of this posting on July 10th, 2015, the Wikipedia size is at 2174 volumes. Assuming each volume is about 4 pounds, that comes out to:\nAbout 8700 pounds.\nIt has increased by more than 20% of its March 2013 size.\nSo, in your smartphone, you have access to a collection of knowledge that, in book form, would be getting bigger by about a volume every other day and heavier by about two pounds a day.\n Widening your jean pockets is a small price to pay.\n004 Mondegreens \u0026amp; Mumpsimuses \u0026amp;\nA lot of people know the name of this symbol, but few know where the name comes from. The term ampersand is what is called a mondegreen (what a gorgeous word!). A mondegreen is a misinterpretation of a phrase as a similar-sounding phrase, usually giving new meaning. In this case, “ampersand\u0026rdquo; is a misinterpretation of the phrase “and per se and,\u0026rdquo; which means:\n“and (as in \u0026amp;) is the word and\u0026rdquo;\nOver time, it got scrunched into “ampersand.” Even though it misinterprets the original phrase, ampersand is quite a beautiful word and an even more beautiful symbol. It is easily my favorite typographical symbol, and I think the biggest reason for this is its creative freedom.\nThere are so many different kinds of ampersands. Some look like 8’s with twist ties in their sides. Others look more like the original ligature combining E and T. And still others seem to take a departure from both extremes. It is a work of art that is so ubiquitous but there is still room to creatively make it your own rare gem. It is a very pretty mondegreen.\nMost mondegreens, however, are less literary and more lyrical. Misinterpretation of lyrics is where the mondegreen shines. There is even another name for the phenomenon called soramimi. There are loads of them, and you can probably find one you have been singing wrong for years.\nYou have probably been in the situation where you are driving in a car with someone and they sing the wrong lyrics: a lyrical mondegreen. If you correct them and they still hold their ground with the wrong lyrics, you can tell them they are a mumpsimus. The term comes from a story of a priest who misread a word as mumpsimus, and when he was told of his error, replied \u0026ldquo; I\u0026rsquo;ve got so used to using the word mumpsimus that I\u0026rsquo;ll just go on saying it that way.\u0026rdquo; They were told the correct way, but they stuck with their old way of thinking. And this doesn’t just have to apply to lyrics and ampersands: it is about learning from misunderstandings.\nI try really hard in life not to be a mumpsimus. There are so many facets to our world and, inevitably, some of our beliefs about how it all works turn out to be mondegreens. We think we understand something but it turns out we are thinking about it all wrong. Maybe you misheard your high school chemistry teachers or misinterpreted a history fact. Maybe you don’t fully understand the significance of a passage in a work of literature. We all go through life with mondegreens littering our brain. We think the world is a certain way. The amazing thing is that you can find out you were wrong about something. And it can be totally awesome. You can correct the mondegreens you have in your mind. In those moments of realization, you have a choice:\nYou can understand how you are wrong and learn from it. You can be amazed that the world is so crazy awesome and keep learning new things. Or you can learn nothing and be a mumpsimus.\nDon’t be a mumpsimus.\nStay open to changing your way of thinking. Learn constantly.\nCorrect your mondegreens.\n005 Make Change Happen I’m partial to a red panda. Mostly because they are so darn cute. It’s like the cute parts of a cat, a panda, a raccoon, and a bear cub all swirled together. Recently, I had red pandas on my mind so I did what most people nowadays do: I looked it up on the Internet. Amidst all of the short videos of red pandas, I kept seeing the Google suggestion for ‘red panda documentary.’ This quickly led me to a wonderful little documentary entitled ‘Cherub of the Mist.’\n Cherub of the Mist is about two red pandas that are released into the wild and it follows their challenges trying to find mates and survive. I watched the film. It is a little under an hour long. After I finished it, I was struck by how much work they put into this little film.\nThe red panda is not the easiest animal to film in the wild. Not to mention there are very few left in the wild. So, making a documentary where your sole focus is red pandas is quite the challenge. It took them 2 years to film all of the footage and if you watch the finished documentary, you’ll notice they comment on a lot of things that are ‘firsts of their kind.’ So, they accomplished an amazing feat: they captured footage of an extremely elusive animal that no one had ever captured before and were able to present it to tell an engaging story, all the while raising awareness about endangered species.\nIt took them about two years. And it took me an hour to watch it. That’s 0.0057% of the time it took for them to make it.\nThis often happens when you create something and present it to the world. There is a fundamental difference between the time to make something and the time to experience something someone else made. Let’s call this difference the Observer Percentage (or OP for short). For ‘Cherub of the Mist,’ the OP is 0.0057%; the time it took me to experience the documentary is 0.0057% of the time it took for the documentary to be made.\nWhen you make something, it takes a lot of work. You need an idea and you need to plan how you are going to execute it. You need equipment and resources to gather information and understand your topic. And you need to present it to others in an understandable and engaging manner. All of this takes time. A lot of time.\nAs another example, consider Christian Marclay’s art installation, The Clock. The piece is a continuous movie displaying thousands of clips that all relate to the current time of day. So, if you walk inside the viewing room at 4:07 pm, there will be some sort of clip that relates to 4:07 pm. The piece takes its clips from movies, TV shows, and other sources, and it took about three years to complete. Three years of gathering clips and connecting them together, getting the sound right, syncing up the clips with a clock, and presenting it as an art installation. It is a masterful creation.\nBut let’s look at it in terms of Observer Percentages. Even if you went to one of the 24-hour showings, the OP would only be 0.091%. When \u0026lsquo;The Clock\u0026rsquo; came to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, I went and watched it for about five hours. So my OP for The Clock is only 0.0019%.\nThis makes me wonder why anyone makes anything. Why put so much time into something someone will experience for only a fraction of the time? Why put so much effort into something that will be experienced so quickly? I think the reason we put so much effort into making things is that during the small amount of time someone experiences your creation, you can affect them in very profound ways.\nWhen you have people experience a creation you have made, you are able to change how they think about all sorts of things. ‘Cherub of the Mist’ exposed me to the difficult challenges that face Red Pandas as well as the general challenge of conservation of endangered species. ‘The Clock’ let me experience time, a constant presence in my life, in a way I had never experienced before. And it doesn’t stop there. There is so much time and effort put into all sorts of aspects of your life.\n Restaurants spend several hours prepping for you to come and eat a meal for 45 minutes ( OP: 10.71%). Singers spend months perfecting a song you will finish in four minutes ( OP: 0.0015%). Filmmakers spend years making a story that can be viewed in two hours ( OP: 0.011%). Scientists spend years on experiments only to have people read papers about them in a few hours ( OP: 0.0086 %).  And even though you may, as an observer, only put in a marginal amount of time or effort, you can be profoundly affected. You can have a very memorable meal. You can relate very deeply and emotionally to a song or film. You can get fascinated by a new scientific discovery. When you make something, you can make change happen. And that is why we will never have a shortage of people making new things, new ideas, new discoveries. The feeling of making change happen is so invigorating. It drives others to make discoveries and inventions. It is wonderful to feel that you have made change happen.\nSo try in your life to make change happen. And notice the amount of time and effort other people put into making change happen.\nIt may take a lot of work, but the reward is worth it.\nFrom the initial idea (a post simply about red pandas) to the final presentable product (a post about time, effort, and making things), this post took about 10 days to make.\nConsidering this post’s word count (about 1000 words) and the average reading speed ( 300 words per minute), the OP for the average reader is about 0.028%. Or 4 minutes.\nI hope you had a memorable 4 minutes.\n","date":1434585600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1434585600,"objectID":"4979e127ec01368c303444ea910935ab","permalink":"/project/extraordinary/","publishdate":"2015-06-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/extraordinary/","section":"project","summary":"Twitter account of what's interesting in the ordinary","tags":["other"],"title":"(Extra)ordinary","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"While I was working at the Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology at Boston University School of Medicine, I spent most of my time building implants. These implants were used to record neuronal firing in rats and allowed the lab to perform experiments that explored the effects of cognitive enhancers. In short, the lab needed to get data from the brains of rats and these implants allowed that data to be acquired in real-time. Think of it like a USB port for a brain: with these implants, we could plug an animal into a computer and get data from it!\nNaturally, these devices are very time-consuming to make; they are made up of dozens of parts that all need to be manufactured to high tolerances. Because of this, a lot of my time in the lab was getting these implants to work properly. I would take notes about how to make each piece and how to put them together. Soon I had amassed a large collection of notes that started to resemble a manual for how to build these implants. I talked with my manager and decided to work on combining my notes into a comprehensive implant manual specifically geared towards undergraduate researchers.\nWhen I started out in the lab, I relied on the senior undergraduate researcher as well as my manager. There was a protocol written up by a graduate student, but it was written for researchers more experienced than I was at the time. I wanted to make something any upcoming scientist could use. My goal was to make a reference that would be approachable to any incoming undergraduate, allowing them to start building implants quickly and efficiently.\nThe result was a 54-page manual that covered all aspects of building the implants. It was built off of my experiences in implant manufacturing as well as working with incoming undergraduates. The act of documenting the manufacturing process helped me better understand the implants as well as give back a useful tool to the lab. It makes me proud to think that even now my manual may be helping new researchers grasp the implant manufacturing process.\n","date":1389052800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1389052800,"objectID":"4dc3ba7fad65bb59ddaae8f8f75d378c","permalink":"/project/implant-manual/","publishdate":"2014-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/implant-manual/","section":"project","summary":"Implant Manual to Aid Undergraduates","tags":["science"],"title":"Implant Manual","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In my junior year of college I did a two-semester-long directed study in the Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology within the Department of Experimental Therapeutics at Boston University’s School of Medicine.

I learned how electrophysiological methods could be used to record from the CA1 region of the hippocampus in rats and allow neural activity data to be extracted in response to effects of cognitive enhancers. I manufactured custom-made neural recording devices, performed several surgeries on the animals to attach the implants, and gained a basic understanding of how the neural activity data can be interpreted and analyzed. In addition, I used the BU Engineering Product Innovation Center to explore how the neural implants could be made more efficiently using 3D-printing technology, which resulted in adoption of a unibody core designed by Dr. Matthew Wilson at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and produced using stereolithography.\n","date":1386806400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1386806400,"objectID":"e21f1b37c6d2fd9bffc891f44742e0fb","permalink":"/project/dstudy/","publishdate":"2013-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dstudy/","section":"project","summary":"Implants for Hippocampal Recording in Rats","tags":["science"],"title":"BU Directed Study","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"While working at the Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology at Boston University School of Medicine, a graduate student asked me to help her solve a problem involving frogs.

To solve this, she wanted to build an enclosure that could keep the frogs in our lab while still complying with all of the animal health and safety regulations. So, she asked me to build a frog enclosure that could do just that.\n     Working with my manager, I designed and built a custom-made frog enclosure that allowed the frogs to be housed on-site. The finished piece had two double-hinged doors for easy access of the tank, air grills and a fan for continuous airflow, an LED light strip hooked up to a timer to simulate light cycles, and a waterproof coating. All the electronics were hooked up to a backup power outlet to ensure the frogs would not be affected by any power failures.
