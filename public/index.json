I plotted his eliminations with a game map overlay and connected them with smooth curves, creating an approximate movement path you can follow from start to finish. Accented with audio blurb annotations, you can get a good sense of his progression through the run.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to do something with Fortnite for a while now, so this serves as a toe in the water. This was a manual creation, but it has got me thinking how it would be lovely to auto-generate these kinds of plots for streamers in the future. Someday.\n  Progression of one of Ninja\u0026rsquo;s Fornite runs   Visualization Notes The yellow dots represent the approximate locations of the eliminated players. The locations were found by watching Ninja\u0026rsquo;s YouTube video, \u0026ldquo; Ninja Destroys The Entire Lobby!! 24 Elim Solo\u0026quot;, and taking screenshots when eliminations were made. The mini map in each screenshot was then used to place a point on the visualization.\nThe light blue path is created by drawing a line between the twenty-four yellow elimination points and applying smooth curves. Because of this, the light blue path is only an approximation of Ninja\u0026rsquo;s movements and is taking liberties at certain spots, particularly with sniper eliminations. For example, the top-most yellow dot in the visualization is far from the preceding elims, implying Ninja walked over to that player to get the elimination. In actuality, Ninj a sniped that player from far away rather than going up a large mountain to attack at close range. It would be interesting in the future to try a more accurate recreation of player movement, but I think this approximation tells a compelling story.\nThe dotted-line portion of the path approximates the initial descent from the bus. The video does not include the bus\u0026rsquo;s transit path, so it is omitted (it would have made things a little crowded, anyway).\nThe blue dots signify when Ninja started using a mech and when he transitioned into a new mech (where \u0026ldquo;mech\u0026rdquo; is the B.R.U.T.E. vehicle). Not all eliminations after those points were made in mechs. For example, up at Salty Springs, he exits the mech to acquire four eliminations before reentering to cover more ground. In general, it would be interesting to further explore how the type of elimination could be better displayed without overloading the viewer (color by weapon used, use of vehicle, etc.).\nThe annotations were taken from Ninja\u0026rsquo;s stream audio after the elimination occurred. They are lightly edited.\nThe dark blue squiggly line defines the border of the southwest corner of the game map. Initially I was going to include the entire outline of the map, but it served no purpose. The location names are placed where they appear on the game map. This causes some overlap of paths, points, and text (particularly at Salty Springs and Fatal Fields), but the intention was to go for accuracy with regards to the game map placement.\nThe text was typeset in Arial; apologies, type-lovers.\nThe color palette was chosen to compliment Ninja\u0026rsquo;s logo identity as of September 2019.\nFortnite Context This run\u0026rsquo;s landing site was Pandora, a crossover event with Borderlands (termed \u0026ldquo;Mayhem\u0026rdquo; in-game). This limited-time rift zone gave players regenerative shields.\nThis run was recorded shortly after changes were made to the turbo build feature, which were later reverted. More info on changes to the game can be found in the Fortnite patch notes.\n","date":1567641600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"c2ac5eea5f43b4d7febdd2bc8a7e168d","permalink":"/project/ninja/","publishdate":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ninja/","section":"project","summary":"Visualization of one of Ninja's Fortnite runs","tags":["Data"],"title":"Ninja, 24 Elim Solo","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I love stand-up comedy and have watched many specials over the years. I thought a collection of comedy specials would be an interesting dataset to explore, which led me to create this project showing selected stand-up specials plotted in terms of their ribaldry, or use of swearing. When looking into analyzing comedy specials, I found practically every comedian used some collection of swear words in their act. The interesting finding was how varied its use was across different comedians and even across different specials from the same comedian. Some comedians rely heavily on them, while others rarely use them at all. Some used them often in their earlier specials, but less so in their later ones. It is interesting to see how a specific comedian uses these words to their advantage as well as when they choose to use specific types of words. By plotting the use of swearing across a comedy special, you can get a sense of a comedian’s style of comedy, how it has changed over the years, and how it differs from other comedians’ styles.\nFor data collection, I created a CSV that contained every timestamp and type of swear word used across several comedy stand-up specials. This CSV was fed through a Processing script that plotted the individual words for each special. The result is a graphic that succinctly orders and displays the relative ribaldry of selected stand-up specials. I am particularly proud of the amount of information that is contained in each plot, including the titles, the release dates, the set lengths (both numerically and visually), the individual word counts, the total word count, the relative severity of words, and the timestamps themselves.\nThis project involved watching a bunch of comedy specials, which was a lot of fun. I enjoyed collecting the data and hope that this project’s collection of stand-up specials will continue to grow. I encourage you to explore the current visualization and check back here periodically for new updates to the dataset.\nAn interactive version of the dataset is now available on my Tableau Public profile.\nThis version includes a word cluster map, plots of swearing timestamps, a heat table, and a plot based on gender. In addition, every page has filters allowing for custom views of the dataset. Enjoy.\nNote: The Tableau version currently has data up to, and including, the specials added on January 18, 2017.\nDataset   123 Specials\n  63 Comedians\n  7,830 Minutes\n  All Words: 13,002 Times\n  F-Word Only: 5,981 Times\n  Source: netflix.com, louisck.net, spotify.com\nA Note on Ordering and Word Choice In this visualization, I define \u0026ldquo;relative ribaldry\u0026rdquo; to be the severity of selected curse words in a comedy special, meaning the curse words classified as more severe are placed higher up the axis. Derivatives of the displayed words are not differentiated between (For example, “D*MMIT is counted as “D*MN” \u0026amp; “BULLSH*T” is counted as “SH*T”). The y-axis shows the different kinds of curse words used in the special and is identical across all comedy specials. However, the collection of words displayed on the y-axis does not necessarily represent every recorded type of curse word for a given special. In addition, other suggestive themes may be present in individual specials that these graphics cannot accurately differentiate between. The collection of words on the y-axis was selected based on use across all specials as well as a desire to include a variety of words that varied in levels of severity. The collection may change over time due to new comedy specials being added. In addition, the ordering of the words based on severity is not intended to be an absolute ranking. Your personal preferences may rank the collection differently, but the current order hopefully provides a relative placing of the words that gives a sense of differences between comedy specials in terms of swearing.\n","date":1567641600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"1ee7875012541e65f2cad69c6c13d80b","permalink":"/project/comedy/","publishdate":"2019-09-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/comedy/","section":"project","summary":"Exploration of Stand-Up Comedy Specials Ordered by Relative Ribaldry","tags":["Data"],"title":"Ribaldry in Stand-Up","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been sketching out font ideas in the margins of college notebooks for years, so I thought it might be time to formalize one of them. The result is Koji, a typeface based off of a simple jig I would draw in my workbooks during class.\n       The main idea of Koji was to base all of the characters off of a simple template. But, as I began formally defining the font, it of course came down to some aesthetic choices. Creating this font was an incredible experience and I hope to improve it more and more, adding new characters to support more languages and tightening up each letter to improve usability.\nWhy Koji? Naming a font is arguably as hard as creating one. I could say it was chosen because Koji fungal blooms are sort of round like this font. Or I could say it\u0026rsquo;s a principal ingredient in fermenting soy sauce, a condiment that is simple yet complex, just like this font. But the truth is far less poetic: it came from an online word finder. I wanted a name that used an uppercase \u0026ldquo;K\u0026rdquo; and a lowercase \u0026ldquo;j\u0026rdquo; because those are two of my favorite letters in this typeface. So I searched for a word that fit the bill and came across \u0026ldquo;Koji\u0026rdquo; and it just grew on me. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to say, it has a cool but as you now know somewhat tacked-on backstory, and it looks good when written in the font, which is always a plus. Overall, a simple and catchy name for what I hope is your new favorite font.\n","date":1546387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546387200,"objectID":"6bd42c11720d8f9a4a72725e357b5b5a","permalink":"/project/koji/","publishdate":"2019-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/koji/","section":"project","summary":"Hand-Made Typeface","tags":["Featured","Design"],"title":"Koji Typeface","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Over the summer, I worked with Joyce Robbins on an online resource for a course at Columbia University called \u0026ldquo;Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization\u0026rdquo;, or EDAV for short.

We wanted to make a resource for students that had all the information about how to get started as well as examples to learn by doing.\nThe result is edav.info/, a resource combining examples, advice, and other things to help students start visualizing/working with R. There are several pages on the basics, pretty examples of different plot types, and helpful discussions on how to get the most out of the course and of R itself. Also, we ensured the resource was easy to modify so students could propose changes and help the quality continuously improve. As an added touch, we created a custom logo for the resource and custom icons for each chapter.

Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec were on the show talking about DearData, their yearlong exploration of data visualization through personal correspondence. For fifty-two weeks, the pair of data visualization experts sent postcards to each other, but these were not your average Hallmark cards. Every postcard was a hand-made figure concerning something they tracked in their lives for that week. Themes ranged from clocks to swearing to privacy and the resulting postcards embodied their personal style of telling stories with data. I loved listening to their project and was intrigued when the podcast ended with a challenge: try it for yourself, dear listener. The podcast asked its audience to have a go and make their own postcard with the theme of \u0026lsquo;podcasts\u0026rsquo; and send it in. I had been interested in data visualization for some time and here was a great excuse to play around with data and inject some creative flair. So I gave it a try.\n    I decided to track WHEN and HOW I listened to podcasts. I recorded the time of day, my listening position (standing, sitting, etc.), and whether I used speakers or headphones. After a week, I had a collection of data points that described my week in podcasts. I made a simple grid and used a light table to fill in the correct cells. The result was an eye-catching postcard that has a lot of hidden data if you look closely.\nIt was a lot of fun tracking my behavior and making the postcard. I encourage you to check out DearData. Also, if you have the desire to track things but aren’t sure how to keep it organized, check out Feltron\u0026lsquo;s apps, Daytum and Reporter, which make it easy to record anything you want to track. Have fun!\n⭐ FiveThirtyEight has posted the collection of postcards they received, totaling seventy-seven. I was excited to see my entry was among their five favorites. I encourage you to explore them all. It’s incredible to see what people can do with data when you let them loose.\nDataset \u0026amp; Findings   20 Podcasts\n  15 Hours\n  Date Range: March 14–20, 2016\n  Most Popular Position: Standing Up\n  Standing Up: 43.96%\n  Sitting: 25.27%\n  Driving: 16.48%\n  Lying Down: 14.29%\n  Most Popular Delivery: Speakers\n  Speakers: 52.75%\n  Headphones: 47.25%\n  ","date":1457136000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1457136000,"objectID":"daa6d51d6508ea881b85fc26dc63fad4","permalink":"/project/postcard/","publishdate":"2016-03-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/postcard/","section":"project","summary":"Hand-Drawn Data Visualization of Podcast Listening","tags":["Data"],"title":"Podcast Postcard","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
