- I tried making some collegiate notebook marginalia into a typeface, and it actually worked and you can try it. It's called [Koji, a highly geometric typeface](projects/koji.qmd) I made by hand. Crazy respect for the crazy people who devote themselves to this. Also, I hate kerning sooo much.
- I started [<i class="bi bi-bezier"></i> making icons for Noun Project](projects/nouns.qmd) after wanting some icon headers for a project I worked on over the summer in grad school. Turned into a fun hobby.
