The main goal was to make something useful with some LLM wramblings. Or at least that became the goal, paired with trying to use a bunch of my [<i class="bi bi-heart-fill"></i> nouns](/nouns). So it became a calendar, where every day has an icon and a generated blurb that referenced that icon.

Pretty manual process for this one: just put on some tunes and asked ChatGPT a bunch of times for a blurb with different words as the focus. Once that was done, I did some wrangling to get it all into a big document with Affinity Publisher.

At the time, I had found that a store in town left out a big cart labeled "free wood", filled with wood cut scraps. That worked well as a backing, then with some hardware, I could make it into a physical calendar. This turned into one of those errands with a strange list of items:

- power drill
- bolt
- hole punch

Construction went quite smoothly. Although I do now have a small hole divot in my foldable particle board table that served as my workbench. A craftsman's scar I spose. 

I mounted the final result in my bathroom. Now I start my morning with a kinda-weird quote and a nice icon. Good way to begin each day. And it worked so nicely that I made another one sans-calendar-days as a wall hook with the leftover pieces I had (always try to have leftovers!).
