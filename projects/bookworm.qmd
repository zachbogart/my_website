This is an Observable Notebook of things I'm reading. 

It's embedded below, though it's easier to [view on Observable](https://observablehq.com/@zachbogart/bookworm).

If you enjoy this, feel free to fork it and track your own reading habits (or whatever else). And if you think [this little project deserves a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/zachbogart), I'd welcome the gesture. It's most likely going towards a hot cocoa or a tea, but it'll certainly be paired with whatever happens to be my current readie. Much appreciated. â˜•

Happy reading...
