> "~~Prison~~ *Grad school* time is slow time. So ya do what ya can to keep going. Some fellas collect stamps. Others build matchstick houses. ~~Andy~~ *Zach* ~~built a library~~ *mostly paid video games and ate good food*. Now he needed a new project. ~~Tommy~~ *Decorating* was it. It was the same reason he spent years ~~shaping and polishing those rocks~~ *doodling ideas in his notebooks*. The same reason he ~~hung his fantasy girlies on the wall~~ *...no comment*. In ~~prison~~ *grad school*, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied. By ~~1966~~ *2018*, right about the time ~~Tommy~~ *he* was getting ready to take his exams, it was ~~Lovely Raquel~~ **putting Post-It's all over the walls**."
