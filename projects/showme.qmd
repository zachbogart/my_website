I enjoy working in Observable, it is a super cool platform. Trying to post some ideas there.

Wanting to get better at Observable, so thought I'd get a little more regimented about it. Created a [public team called @huh](https://observablehq.com/@huh?tab=profile) and posting updates as I go. Excited to see this grow. ðŸŒ±

And checkout the [@huh github repo](https://github.com/zachbogart/huh-data) if you are interested in seeing progress. Trying to post issues there to track ideas.
