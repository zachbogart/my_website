It's one of those intimidating apps that does it all, but it is hepful for seeing what is happening and I like the [staging options](https://confluence.atlassian.com/sourcetreekb/viewing-file-status-of-a-repository-785616002.html) that include nesting, which I find more intuitive than RStudio's output.\n\n### Amend Previous Commit in Sourcetree\n\nI use this often in RStudio, but was not sure where it lived in Sourcetree. It's essentially the \"no wait, but also\" button, adding in a little more to the recent commit. In RStudio, it is a prominent checkbox, but in Sourcetree, **it is under \"Commit Options...\" in the commit dialogue**.\n\n![Amend Commit in Sourcetree](sourcetree-amend-commit.png)\n\n#### Image Credit\n\n[Conflict](https://thenounproject.com/browse/collection-icon/working-with-git-137906/?p=1) by Zach Bogart from [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/zachbogart)"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"theme":{"light":["zephyr","../../../theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"comments":{"giscus":{"repo":"zachbogart/my_website","category":"Blog"}},"toc-location":"left","search":false,"title":"Working with Git","subtitle":"It's helpful till something goes wrong","date":"2022-05-17","categories":["rtfm","git","Sourcetree"],"draft":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
