It was pretty easy to make this into a website, plus it makes adding in plots really seamless.\n\n\nPretty painlessly, was able to revamp my website using Quarto. Some challenges encountered:\n\n-   The navbars and sidebars are independent. I'm not using them to their full potential at the moment.\n-   I can't seem to get the blog title banner to show up on smaller screens. Even had some troubles seeing it when forking the quarto-web repo and looking at their blog. Will have to look into this.\n\nOverall, looking forward to using Quarto more often.\n\nAlways learning,\n\nZach\n\n::: callout-note\n2022-04-24: I ended up getting the title and subtitle to appear in blog posts on smaller screens by copying the [quarto-web repo](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web) more closely. It still feels finicky, though, like it could break if the text banner color is altered. Ongoing and will have to keep in mind when fiddling with things.\n:::\n\n#### Image Credit\n\n[Coder](https://thenounproject.com/browse/collection-icon/coders-154740/?p=1) by Zach Bogart from [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/zachbogart)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"theme":{"light":["zephyr","../../../theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"comments":{"giscus":{"repo":"zachbogart/my_website","category":"Blog"}},"toc-location":"left","search":false,"title":"Hello, Quarto Site","subtitle":"Making a site using Quarto, with only a few problems","date":"2022-04-16","categories":["news"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
