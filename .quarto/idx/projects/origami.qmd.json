You can make dozens of simple modules and turn them into stunning 3D creations. I thought it would be hard to fold anything at college till I found that every print job released through the university gave you a cover sheet. People would recycle these sheets (easily a hundred a day) and I would collect some and use them to make the pieces pictured above. It became a nice way to spend an afternoon over the summer or during some downtime. It is quite meditative to make the units and I would leave the completed pieces around the library on campus as well as various other places.\n\nI easily did this with several hundred cover sheets over the years. I would leave them and in a day or two they would disappear. There is only one that is still in the library: in the IT Center on the 1st floor of Mugar Library, on top of a cabinet, sits a Sonobe piece, occasionally sharing the space with a Jack Oâ€™Lantern. Whatever happened to the rest, I hope people enjoyed them. It is certainly prettier than a lump of sheets in a recycling bin.\n\n![](images/origami1.jpg)\n![](images/origami2.jpg)\n![](images/origami3.jpg)\n![](images/origami4.jpg)\n![](images/origami5.jpg)\n![](images/origami6.jpg)\n![](images/origami7.jpg)\n![](images/origami8.jpg)\n\n\n- [Dodecahedron](http://www.instructables.com/id/Dodecahedron-Modular-Origami-Ornament/)\n- [Six Intersecting Squares](http://www.origaminut.com/174/six-intersecting-squares)\n- [Five Intersecting Tetrahedra](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-fold-a-Five-Intersecting-Tetrahedra-Dodecah/)\n- [Sonobe Unit](http://www.origami-instructions.com/modular-sonobe-unit.html)"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"origami.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"theme":{"light":["zephyr","../theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"title":"Recycled Origami","subtitle":"Making pretty things from discarded print receipts","date":"2011-09-05"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
