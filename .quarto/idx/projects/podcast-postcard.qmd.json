We also admire that he listens to so many podcasts while lying down.\n>\n> [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-you-to-visualize-your-podcast-listening-and-wow-did-you-deliver/)\n\nI was listening to an episode of [What’s The Point?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/whats-the-point/), a podcast about data from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), and getting excited. [Giorgia Lupi](http://giorgialupi.com/) and [Stefanie Posavec](http://www.stefanieposavec.co.uk/) were on the show talking about [DearData](http://www.dear-data.com/), their yearlong exploration of data visualization through personal correspondence. For fifty-two weeks, the pair of data visualization experts sent postcards to each other, but these were not your average Hallmark cards. Every postcard was a hand-made figure concerning something they tracked in their lives for that week. Themes ranged from [clocks](http://www.dear-data.com/by-week/#/week-01/) to [swearing](http://www.dear-data.com/week-37-a-week-of-swearing/) to [privacy](http://www.dear-data.com/week-51-a-week-of-privacy/) and the resulting postcards embodied their personal style of telling stories with data. I loved listening to their project and was intrigued when the podcast ended with a challenge: [try it for yourself, dear listener](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-data-and-fivethirtyeight-want-you-to-visualize-your-podcast-habits/). The podcast asked its audience to have a go and make their own postcard with the theme of 'podcasts' and send it in. I had been interested in data visualization for some time and here was a great excuse to play around with data and inject some creative flair. So I gave it a try.\n\nI decided to track WHEN and HOW I listened to podcasts. I recorded the time of day, my listening position (standing, sitting, etc.), and whether I used speakers or headphones. After a week, I had a collection of data points that described my week in podcasts. I made a simple grid and used a light table to fill in the correct cells. The result was an eye-catching postcard that has a lot of hidden data if you look closely.\n\nIt was a lot of fun tracking my behavior and making the postcard. I encourage you to check out [DearData](http://www.dear-data.com/). Also, if you have the desire to track things but aren’t sure how to keep it organized, check out [Feltron](http://feltron.com/)'s apps, [Daytum](http://feltron.com/Daytum.html) and [Reporter](http://feltron.com/Reporter.html), which make it easy to record anything you want to track. Have fun!\n\n:star: FiveThirtyEight has posted the [collection of postcards they received](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-asked-you-to-visualize-your-podcast-listening-and-wow-did-you-deliver/), totaling seventy-seven. I was excited to see my entry was among their five favorites. I encourage you to explore them all. It’s incredible to see what people can do with data when you let them loose.\n\n\n#### Overview\n- 20 Podcasts\n- 15 Hours\n- Date Range: March 14–20, 2016\n\n#### Breakdown\n- Most Popular Position: Standing Up\n- Standing Up: 43.96%\n- Sitting: 25.27%\n- Driving: 16.48%\n- Lying Down: 14.29%\n- Most Popular Delivery: Speakers\n- Speakers: 52.75%\n- Headphones: 47.25%"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"podcast-postcard.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"theme":{"light":["zephyr","../theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"title":"Podcast Postcard","subtitle":"How do I listen?","date":"2016-03-05"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
