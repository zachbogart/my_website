I have a bunch of [my own icon designs](https://thenounproject.com/zachbogart/uploads/) and [my own bespoke icon collections](https://thenounproject.com/browse/creator/zachbogart/icon-collections) on Noun Project that you can choose from to spice up your own projects. I add new designs often, so check back to see what's available.\n\nCheckout all of my icon designs over at [my Noun Project profile page](https://thenounproject.com/zachbogart/).\n\nNoun Project supports creators when people download their icons. Whether you choose to buy one of my designs individually (fully customizable), sign up to [their NounPro subscription service](https://thenounproject.com/accounts/upgrade/) (full-access, in-app integration, and more), or just do a free basic download of my designs in black (with attribution), you directly support my work and allow me to continue creating great icons. I appreciate it immensely and hope you enjoy my designs.\n\nFor more information about how Noun Project works, checkout [their About page](https://thenounproject.com/about/).\n\n<!--Noun Image Credit-->\n[happy octopus](https://thenounproject.com/zachbogart/collection/adorable-octopus/) by Zach Bogart from [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/zachbogart)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"nouns.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"theme":{"light":["zephyr","../theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"title":"Noun Project Icon Design","subtitle":"Thousands of icons and counting","aliases":["/nouns"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
