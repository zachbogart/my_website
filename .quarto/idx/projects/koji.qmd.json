The result is Koji, a typeface based off of a simple jig I would draw in my workbooks during class.\n\n![](images/koji_name.png)\n\nThe main idea of Koji was to base all of the characters off of a simple template. But, as I began formally defining the font, it of course came down to some aesthetic choices. Creating this font was an incredible experience and I hope to improve it more and more, adding new characters to support more languages and tightening up each letter to improve usability.\n\n- [Basic Latin (U+0020-U+007E)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Latin_(Unicode_block))\n- [Latin-1 Supplement (U+00A0-U+00FF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin-1_Supplement_(Unicode_block))\n\n## Why Koji?\n\nNaming a font is arguably as hard as creating one. I could say it was chosen because [Koji fungal blooms](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Aspergillus_oryzae.jpg) are sort of round like this font. Or I could say it's a principal ingredient in fermenting [soy sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_sauce), a condiment that is simple yet complex, just like this font. But the truth is far less poetic: it came from an [online word finder](https://word.tips/). I wanted a name that used an uppercase \"K\" and a lowercase \"j\" because those are two of my favorite letters in this typeface. So I searched for a word that fit the bill and came across \"Koji\" and it just grew on me. It's easy to say, it has a cool but as you now know somewhat tacked-on backstory, and it looks good when written in the font, which is always a plus. Overall, a simple and catchy name for what I hope is your new favorite font. \n\n## Try it out!\n\nIf you try out the Koji typeface, consider [throwing a digital coffee my way](https://ko-fi.com/zachbogart). Much appreciated.\n\nHope you enjoy the Koji typeface.\n\n## Version Log\n\n**Jan 2019**\n\n- Initial release (1.000)\n- Basic Latin (U+0020-U+007E)\n- Latin-1 Supplement (U+00A0-U+00FF)\n\n## Pictures\n\n![](images/koji_alpha_numerals.png)\n\n![](images/koji_secondary_alphabet.png)\n\n![](images/koji_symbols_etc_supplement_1.png)\n\n![](images/koji_examples.png)\n\n![](images/koji_jig.png)"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"self-contained-math":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"koji.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"theme":{"light":["zephyr","../theme.scss"],"dark":["cyborg"]},"title":"Koji Typeface","subtitle":"A crack at transforming collegiate marginalia into an actual font.","date":"2019-01-02","aliases":["/koji"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
